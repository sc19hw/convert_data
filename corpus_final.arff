' A Self portrait ',China
' Period  Qing dynasty  1644 1911  Medium  ink and color on paper Format  hanging scroll ',China
' Artist s   Ren Xiong  1823 1857  ',China
' Dimensions  177.4   78.5 cm ',China
' Born in Xiaoshan Zhejiang province Ren Xiong lived in Shanghai selling paintings to earn a living. He painted a wide range of subjects particularly specialized in painting figures and Daoist stories. He imitated the paintings of Chen Hongshou  1598 1652  a well known painter of late Ming dynasty  1368 1644 . Ren s works are characterized by the slight exaggeration and distortion of figures. As a key representative of the Shanghai school  in modern times Ren Xiong ranked with Ren Xun  1835 1893  Ren Yi  1840 1896  and Ren Yu  1854 1901  as the Four Rens of Shanghai  and also with Zhu Xiong  1801 1846  and Zhang Xiong  1803 1886  as the Three Xiongs of Shanghai . Although the scroll is not dated the portrait suggests that Ren Xiong is a robust young man in his early thirties. It was a time when drastic social upheavals came one after another. Having witnessed the growing corruption in the Qing government the ups and downs of the Taiping Rebellion as well as the invasion by Western powers the painter wears a contemplative look on his face. By baring his right shoulder the disheveled painter looks as though he were an outlaw of the woods with no trace of the artistic style of literati portraiture such as sitting upright or enjoying a carefree life in the countryside. The drapery brushed with vigorous touches and fine strokes not only conforms to his firm and valiant image but also contrasts with his inner strength and masculinity adding to the drama of the portrait.

' Architecture experts at Shanghai Tongji University have worked out a blueprint to restore one of the holist sites in Tibet a project that is expected to break ground in May. ',China
' Shanghai government plans to raise 30 million yuan  US 3.6 million  to restore the Sangzhuzi Castle in the city Shigatse Tibet and build an on site museum dedicated to the ancient city s culture. The project is expected to take one to two years to complete. ',China
' As a religious site the historical value of the castle is priceless Chang Qing a professor in Tongji s Architecture and Urban Planning College said yesterday. Besides restoring the castle we also have plans to build a multi function sightseeing complex Chang said. ',China
' According to the blueprint the construction will have four stories and will be 92 meters tall. The total construction area of the castle will exceed 8000 square meters. Outside the front gate an open area will be created for people to hold religious rituals while the second floor will host an exhibition hall to celebrate Tibetan culture and history as well as an art gallery. ',China
' Built in 1363 Sangzhuzi Castle is the oldest structure in Shigatse and was among the temporary dwelling places to all previous Panchen Lamas prior to the current one. ',China
' As the original structure of the castle looked like the Potala Palace in Lhasa the best known place of interest in Tibet Sangzhuzi Castle was crowned Little Potala Palace even though it is 330 years older that the Buddhist temple in Lhasa. ',China
' More than 600 years ago a skilled Tibetan architect journeyed to Lhasa to pay tribute to the Buddha. ',China
' As the legend goes when he saw the magnificent Potala Palace he decided to accomplish the same architectural wonder in his hometown of Xigaze which is located some 250 kilometers from Tibet s capital Lhasa. ',China
' He carved the design of the Potala Palace onto a turnip but the turnip shrank as he trekked home. A replica of Potala Palace was built but on a smaller scale said Tashi Namgyai 74 who lives in Xigaze. ',China
' What the local Tibetans call the mini Potala is Sangtsu Tsezung Palace. ',China
' The Sangtsu Tsezung Palace and the Tashilhunbo Monastery the traditional palace residence of Panchen Lama were the most magnificent buildings in Xigaze when we were children said Cering. The 73 year old Tibetan woman lives nearby Sangtsu Tsezung Palace. ',China
' Early this month work has started on the site to restore a series of buildings at Sangtsu Tsezung Palace the oldest building complex in Xigaze. ',China
' Sangtsu Tsezung Palace is little known to people outside of Tibet but a household name in the snow covered area in Southwest China. ',China
' Built in 1363 the main structure of the palace is more than 120 meters tall and looks similar to the famous Potala Palace in Lhasa thus earning the nickname Mini Potala Palace. ',China
' The palace fell into disrepair and is now on the verge of collapse. Most of the contents have been removed but the palace foundation is still solid. ',China
' The renovation project is being sponsored by Shanghai municipal government which is putting up 40 million yuan  US 5 million . ',China
' The Architecture School of Shanghai Tongji University has undertaken the project. ',China
' When it is completed in May 2007 the castle like structure will have 7500 square metres of floor space said Qoi gyi Gyaincain an architect and living Buddha with the Tibet Autonomous Regional Architecture Prospecting and Design Institute. ',China
' For hundreds of years the palace was a place of government and worship for the elite of Tibetan society. ',China
' Common Tibetans were not allowed to go up there. The basement of the palace contains cells for prisoners Cering recalled. ',China
' In the old days parents often frightened children by threatening to send them there if they did not behave themselves. ',China
' Sangtsu Tsezung Palace is an excellent example of Tibetan architecture technique which some believe is even better than the famous Potala Palace which was built about 700 years earlier said Qoi gyi Gyaincain. ',China
' The original Potala Palace in Lhasa was built in the 7th century but was destroyed by fire after it was hit by lightning. ',China
' The Potala Palace was rebuilt about 300 years ago by the 5th Dalai Lama which makes Xigaze s Sangtsu Tsezung Palace 330 years older than the rebuilt Potala Palace. ',China
' We feel in our hearts that like Potala Palace Sangtsu Tsezung Palace is a sacred and magnificent building said Tashi Namgyai. ',China
' From the 14th century to the 15th century Tibet set up 13 administrative centers throughout the region and erected a building in each centre for both religious and administrative purposes. ',China
' Sangtsu Tsezung Palace was the last and largest of the 13 administrative centers to be built and therefore benefited from the skills of many experienced craftspeople. ',China
' The restorers will examine the remains of the palace to better understand Tibetan architecture techniques. ',China
' Archival photographs and records will help architects duplicate the palace s original appearance said Hai Shuanglin an architect in charge of the project from Tongji University. ',China

' Yesterday was Shanghai s coldest July day for 112 years with the mercury topping out at just 21.2 degrees Celsius at the benchmark Xujiahui weather station according to the city s metrological bureau. ',China
' In 1903 the coldest July day came in at a decidedly chilly 20.9 degrees it said. ',China
' The recent heavy rains and a cold air mass are to blame for the dip in temperatures which in the 10 days through Sunday were about 3 degrees lower than normal. ',China
' While the temperature at Xujiahui was 21.2 degrees yesterday in the Pudong New Area the mercury fell to an almost frosty 18.2 forecasters said. ',China
' Today will remain chilly with a high of 22 degrees while tomorrow and Thursday should be much warmer at 26 and 29 degrees respectively. ',China
' Heavier rains are also expected today due to the combined influence of the plum rain belt and Typhoon Linfa the bureau said. ',China
' Linfa was centered more than 1300 kilometers south of Shanghai yesterday afternoon but was steadily moving northeast and is expected to have some impact today and tomorrow. Thursday should be drier but a second tropical cyclone    Typhoon Chan Hom    will bring more wet weather on Friday. ',China

' The gold that lies beneath your feet ',China
' Millions have walked on the floors of Chinese palaces possibly ignoring the valuable tiles that they are stepping on and their history. ',China
' Gold bricks exclusively used in imperial palaces are displayed at the Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Bricks. ',China
' On the floors of Chinese palaces tiles that have been trodden on by millions are called jinzhuan literally gold bricks.  They re not gold but clay. However the cost is astronomical   around one tael of silver in ancient China and 26000 yuan  US 4050  for just one piece today. ',China
' These hidden gems can be found in the halls on the central axis of the Forbidden City such as Hall of Supreme Harmony Hall of Central Harmony and Hall of Preserving Harmony which are known as the Three Great Halls of the Outer Court.  Used exclusively to build imperial palaces these bricks were transported to Beijing from Suzhou and thus called jingzhuan. Jing is the abbreviation for Beijing. ',China
' It finally evolved to gold bricks mainly because of its high cost and metallic sound. ',China
' First appearing during the reign of Emperor Yongle in the Ming Dynasty  1368 1644  the gold bricks were so treasured that only emperors were privileged to use them to decorate palaces  says Sun Jian deputy director of the department of cultural and creative development at Suzhou Lumu Imperial Kiln Gold Bricks Factory. ',China
' People should not belittle jinzhuan. Just imagine how many famous historical figures once kneeled on them. From clay to something exclusively used by emperors jinzhuan embody the wisdom of the ancients and are witnesses to history  says Shen Quannan assistant curator at Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Bricks. ',China
' Ti Gong ',China
' The Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Bricks ',China
' Designed by architect Liu Jiakun the museum has over 1400 ancient gold bricks and houses several sites of ancient imperial kilns. ',China
' Knocking on the bricks produces a metallic sound one of the characteristics of jinzhuan along with their pure cyan color and high quality. There are mainly three sizes of the square bricks   54.4cm 64cm and 70.4cm. ',China
' Though the bricks are just tiles the beauty of them lies within. If you look at the cross section the structure is so solid and fine that pores can hardly be seen  says Jin Jin a state level inheritor of making jinzhuan and owner of the factory. The manufacturing process is extremely time consuming. Only by enduring loneliness can a craftsman make a perfect gold brick.  ',China
' Making one piece of jinzhuan can take two to three years and involves a total of 29 procedures. ',China
' The first step is carefully selecting the soil which is the sole material of making gold bricks. Only that in Xiangcheng District of Suzhou can be used to make the smooth and shiny bricks because the soil there is iron rich. ',China
' Nowadays the earth is mainly purchased from construction sites in the area. The soil resource that the factory has collected is enough to maintain the production of jinzhuan for further 20 to 30 years  Sun says. ',China
' However the resource will finally be used up one day. Anticipating the potential problem the Palace Museum in Beijing has required bricks from Jin s factory be stored for future use. ',China
' Making gold bricks is closely related to the solar terms. In ancient China people dug the earth in winter which was the slack season. The first 13 steps need to be finished before the coming of plum rain season  explains Sun. ',China
' Ti Gong ',China
' A craftsman prepares the clay to make gold bricks. ',China

' A worker feeds chaff into the kiln where gold bricks are being fired. ',China
' The next stage involves 10 procedures including making a wooden mold. ',China
' The clay becomes harder after being kept in a shady place for five to eight months. During the time it should be flipped over every day and the information such as the time the size the supervisor and the name of the kiln need to be engraved on a side of a brick. ',China
' Firing is the most significant phase of the whole process starting in autumn and lasting for 130 days. The base will be fumigated with rice chaff for a month burnt with firewood for another month straw for the third month and pine wood for 40 days. ',China
' There is a strict rule when arranging the bricks in the kiln. The layout of bricks should look like the Chinese character ren     or human. Piling one above another there are seven layers of bricks in total. Not only gold bricks but also normal bricks are fired in the kiln together as those near the fire and on the bottom are easily charred  says Sun. ',China
' The last step is pouring water from the top of the kiln. Due to the high temperature the water is soon vaporized. The bricks turn into a unique blue gray hue after cooling. ',China
' Unfortunately a majority of gold bricks have to be abandoned because they are not perfect   either having cracks or broken corners or the sound they make when knocked is not clear and metallic. ',China
' Ti Gong ',China
' The layout of bricks should look like the Chinese character ren     or human. ',China
' Around 700 800 gold bricks are fired in a kiln. However the production yield is only 25 percent  says Sun. ',China
' The traditional method of making gold bricks once disappeared but was revived by Jin and her colleagues. From 2008 they kept trying before the technique was finally approved by the Palace Museum in 2015 after researchers compared ancient gold bricks with those produced at Jin s factory in hardness density water absorption and other physical properties. ',China
' I was a Chinese teacher before being an inheritor of this skill. In 2006 when my father  also an inheritor  asked me whether I wanted to take over his job I refused as I knew it would be very hard dirty and tiring especially for girls. Two years later he asked me again and I agreed because if I didn t do so the skill would have been lost  says Jin. ',China
' Unlike other artifacts gold bricks can t be made by one person but rather a group of people due to the tedious manufacturing process. Jin says the inheritance of the skill shall focus on teamwork. ',China
' Instead of being used as floor tiles gold bricks nowadays become a decoration or a board where people can play chess and practice calligraphy. ',China

' A private company has come up with proposals to rebuild Beijing s famous Yuanmingyuan Park in Zhejiang Province. ',China
' The Hengdian Group best known for managing a large film and television complex in the east China province made the announcement yesterday. ',China
' Yuanmingyuan the old Summer Palace was a Qing Dynasty Imperial Park in the northwest of Beijing. Construction began in 1709 and continued for 150 years under five emperors. But it was burnt to the ground in 1860 by French and British troops. ',China
' Hengdian will rebuild Yuanmingyuan near Dongyang in the center of the province. A spokesman for the group surnamed Shi said it would be built to scale and cover an area of 350 hectares. Shi said the proposal had gained support from government as it would bring new impetus to the local economy and in particular the tourist industry. ',China
' The company will invest 20 billion yuan  US 2.47 billion  over five years. The park will be located in a remote place in the countryside with hills rivers and farmland which corresponds to the original environment of the real Yuanmingyuan Shi said. It ll be a multi functional theme park. ',China
' The developers says the park would serve as an educational base for patriotism. If visitors compare the magnificent park with the ruins of the Yuanmingyuan in Beijing they ll keep in mind the sufferings of our nation in modern history Shi said. ',China
' The park will also be used as a movie and television set. Hengdian already has a development with an imitation of the Forbidden City in Beijing a Qin Dynasty  221 206BC  palace and a prosperous Song Dynasty  960 1279  downtown street. These attracted 3.2 million visitors last year. ',China
' However this latest project has aroused controversy. Ruan Yisan a history professor at Tongji University in Shanghai said he couldn t see any point in rebuilding the Yuanmingyuan as it had been destroyed. ',China
' The remaining ruins are a witness of history and serve as a good reminder of what happened Ruan said. Therefore any attempt to rebuild the garden will only be an awkward imitation. Moreover the real Yuanmingyuan was not built in just five or 10 years. Ruan suggested the group could use the money to preserve sites that are in urgent need of protection. ',China
' According to Xinhua News Agency China has 2500 theme parks with an investment of 150 billion yuan  US 18.5 billion  but only 10 percent of them make money. ',China

' A lotus blooms in the early morning and slowly closes its petals in the afternoon as the sun reaches its zenith. ',China
' A new bud appears after the old one has bloomed for about 10 days and then withers. The blossom period can last at least two months. ',China
' If grown properly lotuses can flower from the end of May till mid September. Water lilies can bloom even longer from April to end of the year. ',China
' A lotus is usually judged by its color shape of the flowers leaves and the blossom duration   the longer the better which is what the grower is striving for over the years. ',China
' Shuangran Honglou is Tian s latest achievement a flaming red lotus that can bloom till November. It s been registered officially as a new nelumbo breed in the International Water Lily and Water Gardening Society. The breed is a hybrid of a lotus from tropical Thailand and a local Chinese one.

' It s like a child whose genes are decided by the parents   one for the blossom period and the other for the appearance  Tian says. ',China
' It is a long strict process to be approved as a new breed which requires three to five years of observation to ensure a stable shape and properties before being sent to the Society for another one year s monitoring. ',China

' To grow lotuses sounds easy   water mud ventilation and five hour sun exposure every day might do. In addition they aren t affected by rains or storms. ',China
' Just remember lotuses can t bloom if they always stay in the shade  he says. ',China
' Each part of a lotus is treasured. Petals can be boiled to make tea  leaves are a traditional Chinese medicine believed to dispel inner heat  lotus seeds are a household summer snack  and its root can be cooked for fine dining and ground for starch. ',China
' Wine cosmetics and body care with lotus ingredients are also being developed. ',China

China has thousands of years of fine tradition and culture what we need to do is to make full use of our advantages and existing infrastructure forming a new technology based industry and development mode with the core of culture said Liang Guangwei president of Huaqiang culture Technology Group. ',China
' The sustainable development of theme parks ',China
' Contemporary Chinese theme park development is not in a good situation. Data shows that there were less than 200 million visitors that went to theme parks in China each year and only about 10  of parks gained profit. This was because domestic theme parks generally lack strong support from the industry chain and can not form a large scale effect. Besides derivative products and other profitable channels of theme parks are still in the initial stages of development. Theme parks are a culture and economy synthesis. In addition to culture related industries like finance commerce and architecture can all get in depth development. Shen Wangshu deputy director of the Development Research Center in Beijing Academy of Social Science stressed. ',China
' At present Chinese theme parks are walking up to a large scale development road ahead. Huaqiang Group which has constructed some well known theme parks like Special Joy to the World has always focused on independent innovation. Their cultural products cover the theme park digital animation special film and a variety of derivatives. In addition Huaqiang Group has applied for more than 50 Chinese and foreign patents and built more than 60 4D cinema screens in 40 countries in Europe and the US successfully forming an industry chain integrating creation research production and sale. ',China
' It is suggested to complete the basic scale of theme parks and then keep pace with the needs of consumers and development of science through continuous theme park expansion. Only in this way can theme parks achieve sustainable development. said Shen Wangshu. ',China

' The multi award winner says prime time TV  from 7 pm to 10 pm  is dominated mainly by soap operas.Also known as the King of Chinese TV he has taken the role of emperor in various TV series and is one of the most productive and critically acclaimed actors in China. ',China
' Golden Marriage ',China
' During the past few years Zhang has starred in some family themed dramas such as Golden Marriage  2007  which portrays a Chinese couple whose marriage lasts over 50 years  Brother  2008  which tells of the struggles of three brothers  and Big Life  2009  about an optimistic single parent father. ',China
' His latest work My Sweet Home a 20 episode TV series starring veteran actors Liu Peiqi and Li Liqun won wide recognition at the 15th Shanghai Television Festival last month. The story is about the life of 45 year old laid off factory worker Luo Zhigang. ',China
' While the settings and characters in these TV series are native the plot twists coincidences and flair for the dramatic recall soap operas in the West. ',China
' To cater to the local TV watching habits Beijing television station broadcasts three episodes a night which locks viewers to the TV set every evening. ',China
' There are two types of audiences in China  the older generation which accepts various TV series themes and the younger generation which loves modern romance Zhang says. ',China
' Elderly people are stable TV fans while the younger generation is enthusiastic about expressing its opinions on the Internet. Both of them have the power to drive the development of the Chinese TV industry. ',China
' Ever since the first major soap opera made in China the sensationally popular 50 part series called Aspirations audiences have got used to watch family story based TV series. ',China
' First broadcast in 1990 and re broadcast many times since then Aspirations begins in the 1960s and traces 20 years of hardships and joys shared by several families. ',China
' Another TV drama The Happy Life of Gossip Zhang Damin has had similar social feedback since it was first broadcast in 2001. Many Beijngers say the soap opera realistically portrays the lives of common people in Beijing s hutong. Most do not have phones in their homes burn coal to cook and live in cramped conditions. ',China
' Today due to the fast pace of economic development and foreign influences foreign soap operas have also become popular. ',China
' Ten years ago throughout Asia The Jewel in the Palace and Winter Sonata were must see television shows. Korean stars like Lee Young ae from The Jewel in the Palace had a huge fan base in China. ',China
' In recent years however the popularity of Korean soap operas has cooled as audiences prefer to watch fast paced American TV dramas. They buy DVDs of American TV series such as Sex and the City Ugly Betty and Heroes and watch them all evening. Actor Zhang says that though he has seen many American TV soap dramas none of my works have been seen by American TV makers. ',China
' Watching soap operas is a good way to learn about a country s culture and the lives of ordinary people. Foreign TV series have influenced our viewers but not the other way. ',China
' According to Zhang entering the global television market requires a lot of effort and cannot be achieved in a short period of time as DVDs with English subtitles need to be made and media promotion has to be done. However we are still lucky that China has such a big market and we have so many loyal TV fans Zhang says. ',China

'  China Today  Updated  2009 08 07 09 46 ',China
' In 1986 the media again led the trend  a report Yellow Skirts Are Prevalent in Beijing from China Textile Newspaper meant yellow skirts were soon popular across the country. In the late 1980s short skirts were gradually embraced by Chinese women who later became accustomed to wearing them with sweaters during spring and autumn. At that time copying styles was the way to stay in fashion and girls were not embarrassed to all dress the same. ',China
' During the late 1980s fashion shows became a major component of people s cultural life. As well as professional models people were deeply interested in organizing amateur teams for the elderly and children. Chinese fashion gradually became integrated with global trends. ',China
' Individual Styles ',China
' Since the 1990s a sewing machine has no longer been a vital necessity for most Chinese families. Chinese people started to buy ready made clothes and most work in the once booming tailor shops now involves altering garments. China has become the world s largest manufacturer and consumer of clothing. Large cities not only feature various domestic and overseas famous brand franchise stores but also countless stands selling low cost clothes. Consumers especially young people prefer roaming garment markets and dressing distinctively. I can dress anyway I like has become the prevalent attitude. Wearing the same clothes or colors as others now makes people embarrassed. A fashion magazine summed up the globalization of fashion  it is no surprise that a fashionable dress issued in Milan or Paris one day is being worn by women in Beijing or Shanghai the next. ',China
' For youths stars  dress sense has a considerable influence over their choice of apparel. Unlike their parents they wear casual outfits without hesitation. The prevalence of color in men s wear has fundamentally altered China s formerly drab attire. Moreover the changes in women s wear have confounded the older generation. The fashion for slip dresses for example was in the making for nearly two years. Initially they were worn with coats. As coats became simplified the dress  material becomes more and more transparent and light. The slip dress started to be really popular around 1998 and is still in vogue now. ',China
' Hip hop and skater styles are now a craze among some urban youngsters. ',China
' People s dress sense has become a matter of personal taste and individual personality. As well as style material is an important factor. Natural materials such as pure cotton are quite popular. Expensive ones like cashmere have also entered ordinary people s lives while some fashionable stars are now promoting the ethics of dressing. It is a disgrace to dress me up at the cost of an animal s life said popular Chinese actress Sun Li who never wears fur and was awarded the 2008 Best Dressed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals an international animal rights organization. ',China
' In line with the growth of national power people s confidence and sense of pride to their own culture has also increased. Movie star Maggie Cheung wore over 20 cheongsams in the popular film In the Mood for Love which gave Chinese women a feel for the beauty of traditional Chinese clothing. Cheongsams have consequently become a favorite style once again. Showing little resemblance to the cheongsams of the Qing Dynasty  1644 1911  today s dresses reveal not only the distinctive elegance and tenderness of Chinese women but also their graceful posture. Revised Chinese jackets have also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity after world leaders were photographed wearing Tang style suits at the APEC meeting in Shanghai in 2001. ',China
' People who love Chinese classical culture have advocated the campaign for Han Dynasty costumes. They believe stylish Chinese styles actually embody the characteristics of ethnic minorities in north China but not the genuine clothing of the Han majority which impressed people with its free and elegant feel. Participants in the campaign are mainly young people born in the 1980s and 1990s. ',China
' World leaders were photographed wearing Tang style suits at the APEC meeting in Shanghai in 2001. This photo displayed in a shop window attracted Shanghai citizens. ',China
' As illustrated above nearly every decade has seen Chinese society remade to an astonishing extent which can be traced through clothing  from cheongsams to the People s Suit Lenin Coat to military uniforms etc. Garments tell the story of China s modern history. ',China

' Although there are more than 360 ancient local operas in China Peking Opera is known as China s national opera despite its comparatively young 200 year history. ',China
' Although it is called Peking Opera the origins of Peking Opera are not in Beijing but in the provinces of Anhui  East China  and Hubei  South central China . Its rise is due in great part to the patronage of the imperial royalties. ',China
' Peking Opera is a purely Chinese opera form dating back to the year 1790 when the famous Four Anhui Opera Troupes first came to Beijing in celebration of the 80th birthday of Emperor Qianlong  1711 1799  of the Qing Dynasty  1644 1911 . The tour was a hit and the troupes stayed. In 1828 some famous Hubei Opera Troupe players came to Beijing. ',China
' The artists of Hubei and Anhui troupes often jointly performed on stage and absorbed repertoires music arias and performance techniques from each other and from other operas like Kun Qu Qin Qiang and Bang Zi as well as the local dialect and customs of Beijing. Its repertoires mainly depict fairy tales of preceding dynasties and important historical events. ',China
' It was after 1840 that Peking Opera formally took shape growing even faster during the reign of the Empress Dowager Cixi  1835 1908  who was an opera aficionado. Classic Peking Opera repertoires and the names of the first generation masters were on the lips of people in Beijing and eventually prevalent around the country. ',China
' Main Features ',China
' Unlike European operas which usually concentrate on one kind of performance in one stage representation Peking Opera integrates music singing dance costume art makeup acting andacrobaticsinto a unique whole. ',China
' 1. Roles ',China

' Chou  comic role which means clown  a wise and funny man usually with a low social status is divided into wen chou and wu chou. The former can read and write well and the latter can fight. ',China
' 2. Facial Make up ',China
' Facial make up  Lianpu  in Peking Opera is mostly applied to the male roles of jing and chou with particular styles to symbolize the different personalities characteristics and fates of the roles. ',China
' Some people argue that the facial make up is similar to the mask. Nevertheless there are great differences between the two in that masks are separate from the face. ',China

' As China becomes increasingly urbanized it has to find space for its urban and rural citizens as both groups become increasingly integrated. Experts suggest a possible model may be re inventing a garden city. Liu Yujie explores the concept. ',China
' China s mega cities are bursting at the seams. The country is now undergoing the quickest and biggest urbanization in the history of mankind. It is estimated that by 2025 China will have 400 million more people living in its cities raising its urban population to 900 million. Its current population already numbers 1.37 billion. ',China
' Guillermo Munro   China Daily ',China
' To cope with changing demographics and psychographics experts say future urban development requires the rural and city relationship to change from the rural serving urban mode to a cooperative brotherhood. ',China
' The situation is still immensely fluid and China s cities are changing constantly both in size and character. As they say it s changing every year with a transformation every three years. ',China
' New satellite towns are mushrooming on the urban fringes while city ring roads are rippling outwards into the countryside at amazing speed. In Beijing alone traffic congestion has already mired the fourth and fifth ring roads once considered countryside. ',China
' The problems are also cropping up with equal speed. ',China
' Satellite maps collected by Professor Joshua Bolchover at the University of Hong Kong bring the problem sharply into focus. They track the changing rural urban framework in the past 30 years and suggest that cities are brutally devouring surrounding rural land and rapidly reducing the amount of arable land. ',China
' Where has it all gone  New residential blocks new industrial zones new financial centers and the other inevitable signs and signatures of economic growth have sprung up almost overnight. ',China
' This is not a sustainable growth pattern especially when China has the world s largest population to feed. ',China
' Concerned urban planners are also starting to note the social and physical effects of the diaspora when displaced rural communities are forced into the cities. ',China
' A trend of thought is gradually taking shape and this is the concept of the garden city an amalgamation of country and city that is being mooted by architects and city planners. ',China
' Already some experts have criticized current building policies that demand a certain percentage of land to be put aside for picturesque greenery belt. They feel this merely caters to the sensitivities of China s emerging petite bourgeoisie. The land they say is completely unproductive useless and ignorant of the crisis of diminishing arable land. ',China
' Hua Li from Tao Architects is among the many professionals with such a voice. His argument is supported by a long term study on this subject. He says the answer is to preserve patches of productive farmland within urban boundaries. ',China
' This will not only bring work and purpose for displaced farmers but also reduce food miles. As Hua says less transportation means we have fresh agricultural products at lower costs and less carbon emission in the city. Urban farmland can also be showcased for agricultural tourism and education. ',China
' Hua is not grabbing at ideas in the air. The concept is already practiced at the grassroot level. ',China
' Zhang Guichun a 55 year old Beijinger has astonished the local community with his organic hanging garden on the roof of his traditional courtyard home north of Tian Tan or the Temple of Heaven in southern Beijing. ',China
' Even if we don t have enough land in the city agriculture can go vertical up to roof and balcony Zhang notes. ',China
' Zhang a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner began creating his hanging garden five years ago and now it is home to some 30 kinds of vegetables and fruit including tomatoes cucumbers sweet bell peppers melons and watermelons   all enough to feed his family. ',China
' For Zhang the rooftop project translates to tangible benefits such as safe nutritious vegetables a cooler home in summer fewer mosquitoes  thanks to the tomatoes which are natural insect repellents  and better bonding with neighbors. ',China
' Neighbors enjoy dropping by for a relaxing chat or just to see how well the lovely vegetables and fruit are doing. ',China
' People like Zhang are still rare. The greening of roof space with vegetables and fruit takes skill and energy. ',China
' But with more positive media exposure and advanced technology I believe my experiment has the prospect of becoming common practice in future. By then our cities will no longer look so gray when seen from the satellites. ',China

' File photo taken in 1988 shows Xi Jinping  front  then secretary of the Ningde Prefecture Committee of the Communist Party of China  CPC  participates in farm work during his investigation in the countryside.  Xinhua  ',China
' Making empty talk is harmful to the nation while doing practical work can help it thrive Xi said during a visit to The Road Toward Renewal exhibition in Beijing on the 15th day after his election as the CPC s new helmsman. ',China
' To put practical work in place Xi presided over a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee that adopted eight measures to improve Party work style and tighten the bond with the people. The measures include more meetings with the people traveling light with a small entourage and using fewer traffic controls shortening meetings and speeches. The new measures have earned acclaim both at home and abroad. ',China
' Only solid work ensures that one will take the lead Xi has said. He has demanded concrete effort to tackle issues the people care about most. He believes that without implementation the best blueprint will be nothing more than a castle in the air. ',China
' When he served in Zhengding county Xi said that developing human resources was the key to shaking off poverty and backwardness in the county. He attended to the job himself by inviting professionals to the county and drawing up recruitment advertisements for talented personnel from across the country. ',China
' In the winter of 1983 he traveled to the provincial capital of Shijiazhuang to invite a cosmetics expert to work in Zhengding. Without a detailed address for the expert he went door to door asking where the expert lived and finally found him at night after yelling his name near his home. Xi and the expert talked until midnight and Xi finally persuaded the man to work in Zhengding. The expert later created more than 300000 yuan in revenue for the county within the first year. ',China
' In the same year Xi decided to publish nine ways for recruiting talented personnel something that was rare at the time and became a front page story in the Hebei Daily. He wrote more than 100 letters to experts and scholars as well as colleges and research institutions and paid visits to dozens of experts. Within two years Zhengding attracted 683 talented personnel and hired 53 well known experts as economic counselors. ',China
' Xi together with his colleague Lu Yulan then deputy Party chief of Zhengding despite heavy pressure told superior authorities about the excessive burden faced by the county due to compulsory grain purchases. The issue was eventually resolved. ',China
' In Ningde Xi was also practical and realistic. He pooled resources to implement aquaculture of the large yellow croaker a local specialty and greatly increased the income of local farmers. ',China
' He also ordered Party and government offices to make things convenient for the people. When serving in Fuzhou he advocated the principle of special procedures for special issues and do things now to make the government more efficient. This principle was attractive to numerous Taiwan enterprises and helped boost the local economy. He also proposed the compilation of two handbooks on government procedures for residents and overseas businesspeople. ',China
' In 2000 Xi initiated a move across Fujian to make the government more efficient. He proposed changes in government functions and procedures to reduce the number of matters that require government approval. By the end of 2001 the number was reduced by 40.4 percent or 606 items. ',China
' In 2001 Fujian became the first province in China to enact a policy making government affairs public. ',China
' In August 2002 Xi published an article on a major newspaper on The Experience of Jinjiang which emphasized the importance of the private economy in the development of the county. Also in 2002 he published an article on Nanping City s effort to send officials to work in villages. The practice of Nanping was later introduced all over the province thus enhancing ties between officials and farmers and making officials more oriented towards grassroots achievement. ',China
' In Zhejiang Xi stressed provincial development in the fields of public security the environment culture the rule of law and the marine economy. ',China
' To achieve these goals he made an individual case study in addition to making overall arrangements. In order to know how the localities were affected by provincial policies he went five times to a less developed mountain village called Xiajiang within less than two years. ',China
' He paid special attention to the marine economy. In December 2002 he put forward the goal of building Zhejiang into a province with a strong marine economy followed by guidelines and plans to realize this goal. The marine economy in Zhejiang has since developed quickly with annual growth of 19.3 percent. It accounted for nearly 8 percent of the Zhejiang economy in 2005. ',China
' He pushed for the integration of Ningbo and Zhoushan harbors. In 2006 Ningbo Zhoushan harbor had 420 million tonnes of cargo throughput ranking the second in China and among the world s top three. ',China
' He also pushed for the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge an icon of cross sea bridges in China and once the world s longest cross sea bridge. ',China
' In 2003 Xi proposed that rural communities should be more like urban communities and efforts should be made to reduce the urban rural gap in quality of life. ',China
' Zhejiang had realized the development targets one by one during Xi s tenure. The province had the highest rating in ecology and the environment among all provincial level regions in 2005. In 2006 94.77 percent of the people were satisfied with the province s public security making Zhejiang one of the safest provinces in the country. ',China
' When Xi was in Zhejiang the province s GDP exceeded 1 trillion yuan in 2004 GDP per capita exceeded 3000 US dollars in 2005 and stood at nearly 4000 US dollars in 2006. The province ranked the fourth in sustainable development in 2006 next to Shanghai Beijing and Tianjin. ',China
' Furthermore all the province s poverty stricken counties and townships shook off poverty during the period. ',China
' In 2007 Xi was appointed secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee. ',China
' Within a month of his appointment Xi conducted research on the people s livelihood development the Shanghai World Expo and the fight against corruption. The ninth Shanghai municipal congress of the CPC was successfully held which invigorated local officials rebuilt Shanghai s image and set forth a blueprint for Shanghai for the next five years. ',China
' Xi has said that a county Party chief should visit all the villages within the county a city Party chief all the townships and a provincial Party chief all the counties and cities. ',China
' He visited all the villages in Zhengding. In Ningde he visited nine counties within the first three months and traveled to most townships later on. After he was transferred to Zhejiang in 2002 he visited all 90 counties in just over a year. During his tenure in Shanghai he visited all 19 districts and counties in seven months. After he came to work in the central authority he visited all the 31 provinces regions and municipalities on the mainland. ',China

' Hukou reform expected to be a gradual process ',China
' Updated  2013 11 15 06 38 ',China
' By Li Yang  China Daily USA  ',China
' Central government to tackle issue through indirect means analysts say ',China
' Xu Shaoshi minister of the National Development and Reform Commission promised to revise and improve the policy suggestion on urbanization that his commission submitted to the State Council in June. ',China
' He made the remarks on Wednesday during the first internal conference since the recent plenum. ',China
' Xu s stance appeared to confirm predictions that the central government will gradually modify urban and rural hukou  household registration  rather than canceling the controversial system overnight. ',China
' In June the commission suggested the government should completely lift hukou control in small towns and cities   a bid to ease restrictions in middle level cities   while gradually broadening conditions to apply for hukou in big cities. It also urged revamping hukou application conditions for megacities. ',China
' Experts believe the central government will approach the hukou issue indirectly by providing farmers with more property income and basic citizen welfare treatment. ',China
' Hukou reform would be one result of rural land reform urbanization and social security although the communique of the just concluded Third Plenum of the Communist Party of China s 18th Central Committee did not mention it by name. The communique rather stressed a balanced distribution of public resources and equalization of social welfare which some say will ultimately yield the desired result. ',China
' The communique has actually pointed out a clear direction and roadmap to break the hukou based dual structure of city and countryside by addressing the welfare disparity said Zhang Liqun an economy researcher at the National Development Research Center of the State Council. The integration of rural and urban is good for modernization of agriculture and healthy urbanization. ',China
' Wang Yongjun professor of finance at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing said the equalization of welfare does not mean giving all citizens exactly the same level of social security. ',China
' It means that the minimum welfare standard for all citizens should be guaranteed by the government as its obligation to the people he said. ',China
' Analysts believe the equalization of public services mentioned in the communique is the Party s direct response to the public s cry for hukou reform   especially for migrant workers   with the concept of granting property rights to farmers part of the same message. ',China
' Cao Yuanzheng chief economist of the Bank of China told the media  The integration of public services is the essence of healthy urbanization and farmers will have the freedom to make a choice between the city and the countryside. ',China
' China has about 300 million migrant workers many of whom leave their farmland uncultivated to work in cities without having the privileges that come with having hukou there. ',China
' The integration of urban and rural in particular welfare and public services will diminish the difference between city and countryside hukou by a large margin and then the hukou system will exist only in name Cao said. ',China
' All depends on the future implementation as no reform can be carried out separately. ',China
' The plenum s call for a unified construction land market for city and countryside is crucial for achieving long overdue property rights for farmers experts say. Granting them the right to transfer mortgage or rent land is an immediate way to provide benefits since it takes a long time for public resources and services to adjust. ',China
' A widely held belief is that government should set up a profit distribution system that is well regulated   along with the unified land transfer market   to avoid grassroots governments  peeling away the farmers  profits. ',China
' China to deepen rural reforms ',China

' Central government policy on the countryside agriculture and farmers has been effective in arousing enthusiasm in the new century and has boosted the development of agriculture and the countryside the statement said. ',China
' Reform started in the countryside and rural growth has contributed much to the leap from being barely fed and clothed to moderate prosperity. ',China
' When defining a moderately prosperous society the key is to observe the condition of farmers the statement said. ',China
' It must be noted that agriculture is still the weakest among the four pursuits of industrialization informatization urbanization and agricultural modernization. The countryside still lags behind the statement said. ',China
' If China wants to be strong agriculture must be strong. If China wants to be beautiful the countryside must be beautiful. If China wants to get rich the farmers must get rich the statement said. ',China
' Tackling problems in the countryside should be at the core of work of the central authorities the statement said. ',China
' Full bowls of rice ',China
' Populous as China is the task of simply feeding the people remains a high priority the statement said. ',China
' The bowls of the Chinese in any situation must rest soundly in our own hands. Our bowls should be filled mainly with Chinese grain. Only when a country is basically self sufficient in food can it take the initiative in food security and grasp the overall situation for economic and social growth it said. ',China
' China has set a red line guarantee that arable land never shrinks to less than 1.8 billion mu  120 million hectares . The line should be strictly followed the statement stressed. ',China
' To ensure the farmers profit from grain planting and the key production bases are active in encouraging farmers to plant grain more efforts should be made to link agricultural subsidies with grain output it said. ',China
' Irreplaceable rural families ',China
' To stick to the central authorities  rural policies the first lies in the basic rural management system. ',China
' Rural land is owned by the peasantry collectively and this is the soul of the rural basic management system the statement read. ',China
' Collective land should be contracted by rural families namely members of the collective economic organizations. ',China
' No other party can substitute the rural family status in contracting land and no matter how the right to contract for management is transferred the right to contract collective land belongs to rural families it said. ',China
' The subjects of the rights to contract for management will grow apart from the subjects of the rights to manage. This is the new trend for China s agricultural production relations the statement stressed. ',China

' Peter Phillips son of Princess Anne was co chairman of the festival with his father Mark Phillips an Olympic gold medal winning horseman and ex husband of Anne. Phillips also expressed great appreciation for Equex s efforts to promote cultural exchanges between China and the United Kingdom through equestrian sports. ',China
' I think what Equex has done will help people in the equestrian industry to understand that horses in China s history go back much further than the Anglo Saxon culture says Phillips. ',China
' It is important to emphasize this part of Chinese culture to the outside world. So if the general public understands about this they will want to take an interest in equestrian events in China says Phillips. ',China
' Phillips says it is important to have Equex as a partner for the Festival of British Eventing as it gives us an additional seal of approval that we are one of the top events in the country. ',China
' He met Lee two years ago when Equex first established itself in the UK market and started to look for partners to work with. Lee then invited Phillips to the first Shanghai International Horse Festival in December 2013 which Phillips says he enjoyed. ',China
' The Shanghai festival organized by Equex is a week of equestrian performance competitions symposiums banquets and a charity auction.

' I watched the opening ceremony and events on the first day which I thought were really good. We saw a good mix on display Phillips says. ',China
' He says Equex s participation in the Festival of British Eventing should help to attract more top riders and international audiences to Horse on the Bund. ',China
' I think the more Equex does here in the UK the more they will increase awareness among the audiences they hope to invite to Shanghai. As Equex becomes known in the UK marketplace it adds to its level of authenticity in the eyes of the international audience Phillips says. ',China
' As one country of origin for horseracing and equestrian events horses have a special place in British culture Phillips says. ',China

' Chinese knot handicrafts ',China
' Chinese Knot is a decorative handicraft that began as a folk art in Tang and Song Dynasties and became popular in Ming and Qing Dynasties. It is distinctive for its complicated pattern is woven separately from one piece of thread. In Chinese  knot  means reunion peace marriage love acquaintance and so on. Chinese knots are often used to express the above good wishes. ',China
' The material of the thread can be the cotton nylon and so on and many of them are red. The exquisitely symmetrical knots that come in so many forms are the valuable cultural heritage of China. ',China
' The Chinese Knots are named according to their different shapes usages and origins. The treasure knot for example is with the appearance of  Yuanbao  the Chinese ancient golden ingot. And the button knot which has the function as the button. Each type of Chinese Knot usually has a beautiful and auspicious name. ',China
' In the ancient time the knots are pulled tightly and sturdily together that can be used for binding or wrapping which making them very practical. In addition it is endowed with high decorative value by its complicated structure. Almost all basic Chinese knots are symmetrical which has set certain technical limitations on the design and creation of new patterns. Traditionally symmetry pattern suites the aesthetic standards of the Chinese people well. Moreover the symmetrical designs are the most popular among Chinese people visually. ',China
' Chinese people have known how to tie knots using cords ever since they began learned how to attach animal fur to their bodies to keep warm thousands of years ago. As civilization advanced Chinese people used knots for more than just fastening and wrapping. Knots were also used to record the events while others had ornamental functions. ',China
' Nowadays the Chinese knot has been served as both the fixtures and decoration of palace halls and the daily implements of countryside households since long time ago. Large Chinese knot served as wall hangings have the same decorative value as fine paintings or photographs and are perfectly suitable for decorating a parlor or study as well as the hall. The Chinese knot with its classic elegance and ever changing patterns is both practical and ornamental fully reflecting the grace of Chinese culture. ',China
' A fateful knock at the door ',China
' The flow of culture is often amorphous. It is very difficult to trace the cloud like drifting of a foreign cultural influence especially during times of upheavals. But there are moments and figures that stand out like signposts that point to a trend larger than themselves. ',China
' On March 26 1977 Beethoven s Fifth Symphony was played at Beijing s Cultural Palace of Nationalities with the final two movements broadcast live through radio and television. Norman Lebrecht a renowned classical music critic happened to be in Hong Kong that day and caught the broadcast. He ran down the hotel corridor and into the bar yelling The  cultural revolution  is over  ',China
' This little incident is chronicled in the new book Beethoven in China  How the Great Composer Became an Icon in the People s Republic. Meticulously researched and affectionately written by Jindong Cai and Sheila Melvin it offers a cornucopia of details about how Beethoven of all Western musicians turned into a barometer for China s political climate. ',China
' Li Delun the conductor of that performance was granted permission only three days before the concert and by nothing less than the standing committee of the Communist Party Politburo to play Fate as this symphony is popularly known. ',China
' The official newspaper was wary and printed only the Chinese music in the program. Still music lovers found out and scrambled for tickets while foreign press agencies reported on the symbolic significance of the inclusion of the Beethoven symphony write Cai and Melvin. ',China
' I still remember the early post cultural revolution years when Fate was the most famous symphony in China with every radio show incessantly drumming home the message that the opening bars of the symphony signify the knocking of fate on your door. ',China
' But little did I know that Beethoven was played before the cultural revolution ended in 1976. Which leads to the most engrossing tidbit in the book  Jiang Qing s insistence on Beethoven s Sixth  Pastoral  Symphony from the Philadelphia Orchestra s historic tour of China in 1973. ',China
' Her choice was not relayed to the orchestra until the American musicians had already landed in Shanghai. Conductor Eugene Ormandy had chosen the Fifth but the Chinese side repeatedly broached the Sixth without realizing that the maestro had an aversion toward this particular piece and they had not brought the scores anyway. Nor did the American negotiators realize that the Sixth was the choice of Madam Mao. ',China
' Eventually the American representatives had to come up with an impromptu but very politically attuned interpretation to change Ormandy s mind. It went like this  the Pastoral themes represented peasant life in the countryside. The storm suggests the peasant revolution China had been through. And the triumphant end of the symphony should be interpreted as the new world that is China in its current state. ',China
' While this reading sits comfortably with the prevailing trends of over politicizing art and literature in those days the real answer as explained by Cai and Melvin is much simpler  Jiang preferred program music over abstract ones. Because the Pastoral can be elucidated section by section the composer had left literary notes it can be explained in layman s terms. And Jiang considered that accessibility a politically correct sign for symphonic music. ',China
' Beethoven like Shakespeare Tolstoy and all great writers and artists were banned in the early years of the cultural revolution. But starting from Nixon s historic visit to China in 1972 there were imperceptible changes. To entertain foreign guests musicians in exile were called back. ',China
' Premier Zhou Enlai secretly summoned conductor Li for materials on all nine of Beethoven s symphonies. The reason he chose Beethoven  Henry Kissinger the guest in honor is of German descent. But the Chinese musicians had gotten rusty by then. Their playing of the Pastoral was so embarrassing that the legendary US diplomat wrote in his memoir that he was not clear exactly what was being played or from which direction on the page. ',China
' Of course Li and the musicians were not to blame. They had not touched this music for years. But according to the authors of the book Beethoven was actually among the lucky ones who enjoyed a flourishing decade right after the founding of the People s Republic in 1949. And it was to the credit of the influence of the Soviet Union which included Beethoven in the list of good bourgeois artists  unlike Debussy for example . Lenin a godlike figure to the revolutionaries had enthused over the German composer leaving behind detailed accounts of his love for the music. ',China
' Despite the weight carried by Lenin Beethoven had always polarized China s revolutionaries even before the founding of the People s Republic. ',China
' As the book reveals some of them believed that Beethoven could infuse them with a fighting spirit necessary for battling their foes while others saw him as just one of those bourgeois elements from Europe probably akin to what some in today s America would call dead white guys. The difference is those who despise classics and their creators in the US are not in a position to deprive those who love and champion them of their freedom or even right to life. ',China
' We live in an age when Beethoven is no longer controversial and classical music is the least censored of all. I believe it is a good thing that a Beethoven program does not make it into the news. Performances of works by titans of world civilization should not be viewed through a prism of politics period. ',China
' I remember the time Shakespeare s The Merchant of Venice was produced in China around the mid 1980s  the international press wanted to know whether it signaled a certain direction for China s diplomatic relations with Israel.  Shylock in the play is a Jew.  Nowadays such questions would sound ridiculous. ',China
' Around the same time I encountered a cultural official in Beijing who mistook Beethoven for a pop singer from Taiwan.  The Chinese transliteration for Beethoven contains a character fen which usually goes into female names.  More than her ignorance it denotes another target for politicizing art and entertainment. And this time it was Teresa Teng who was sweeping the whole nation with her sweet melodies. This is the small anecdote I d like to contribute to Cai and Melvin. ',China
' Of course nowadays Teng is totally accepted and even sounds conservative to most ears. ',China

' Asked to name one particular funerary object he remembers most clearly Sun Xianbao who took part in excavating the Dingling Mausoleum in Beijing 60 years ago cites a pair of jade rabbit earrings. ',China
' The rabbits set in gold and with ruby stones as their eyes once dangled from the ears of Empress Xiaojing when she was buried in 1603. Married to Emperor Wanli she had the good fortune to give birth to a son who ultimately succeeded his father but the misfortune to fall out of the emperor s favor after their fleeting relationship. ',China
' The Dingling Mausoleum in northwestern Beijing is the burial ground Wanli built for himself and shared with his two empresses including Xiaojing. ',China
' Despite being banished to a corner of the Forbidden City out of her husband s sight Empress Xiaojing Xiaojing being the funerary title of the empress whose surname was Wang but whose full name remains a mystery by virtue of being the mother of Wanli s eldest son for much of her life remained at the center of a power struggle of which there would be no winner.

' The Fragrant Hills Park  Xiangshan gongyuan  is located 20 kilometers northwest of Beijing and not far from the Summer Palace. The name of the park derives not from the fresh air or aroma in the area but in the shape of the hills themselves. If you look close enough  and with a bit of imagination thrown in  you can just make out the shape of an incense burner at the peak of the hills. ',China
' The best time to the hill is autumn when the red leaves decorating the trees on the hillside add an extra special glow to the area. ',China
' In fact many Beijingers come here every year to collect red maple leaves. The Fragrant Hills Park is also known as the Garden of Congenial Tranquility. However it is generally pretty busy here unless you escape the crowds and head into the woods. Take a chair lift or hike up the peak itself for great views of the surrounding countryside. Once you reach Incense burner peak and if you are felling fit and brave head off on some of the marked trails and delve into the woodlands. ',China
' The hills and woods were a favorite country retreat of the emperors. The building of Temples began here in the Jin Dynasty  1186 AD  and by the Qing Dynasty  1745 AD  28 had been erected in the Garden of Congenial Tranquility. In 1860 and again in 1900 the Garden was seriously destroyed by fire and many of the temples and halls ruined. Today only some of the buildings have been restored. When the Central Committee of the Communist Party moved to Beijing from Hubei Mao made Double Purity Villa his residence here. Inside the Villa are various displays and cultural relics. However it s the views of the countryside which are the most attractive thing about the Park. From Ghost Fear peak on a fine day  Ghosts apparently fear heights   one can see the Yongding River Luding Bridge Prospect Hills Summer Palace Yuquan Hill and the outskirts of the city. ',China

' I castrated my cat the other day. Well not me personally. I didn t slip while cutting up his salmon dinner or something grisly like that. ',China
' No I paid a vet. He actually came to my home and did it which was convenient. Another wonder of China s growing online to offline industry although I don t think I ll look at my coffee table in quite the same way again. ',China
' I didn t have the stomach to stick around and watch the procedure  my wife was there of course to post the action live on WeChat  but I popped home from work to see how he was doing shortly after the op. He was groggy but when he heard my voice he lifted his tiny head and began crawling toward me. ',China
' It was at this moment I realized I actually had affection for this troublesome ball of fur. ',China
' Billy the cat came to live with us the same way as all our pets  without my prior knowledge. I returned home one day to find him curled up on our couch my wife grinning ear to ear. She d been after getting a cat for ages but I d steadfastly refused  just like I had with the rabbit which of course we also ended up getting . ',China
' They say you re either a cat person or a dog person. My family had always had dogs and growing up I d always hated cats with a passion. ',China
' Looking back it probably had a lot to do with Thomas a tabby one of my uncles owned. I remember as a teenager him scratching and hissing at me and generally just giving me the ol  stink eye whenever I was about. ',China
' He was a bully I said while discussing all this with my mother some years ago long after Thomas had gone to that Great Kitty Litter in the Sky. He had it in for me. I could see it in his eyes. ',China
' My mother simply shook her head. So you don t remember swinging him around by his tail when you were about 5 years old then  she asked. I didn t remember no. ',China
' OK so obviously Thomas wasn t totally to blame for the breakdown in our relationship. Still I was determined not to like Billy. ',China
' My wife grew up in the countryside of eastern China and feels at home with having animals running around the place. They re cute she protested after I expressed my ill feelings for felines. But I d seen my friend s two cats toying with half dead birds and terrified mice too many times to see them as benign house pets. ',China
' Yet that morning in his half awake state Billy won me over. And I suppose it also doesn t hurt that his black and white pattern makes it look like he s got a mustache like the great Groucho Marx. ',China
' Now the cat and I are inseparable and most nights you ll find him perched on my chest purring away. Of course this is not what my wife had had in mind when she agreed to take Billy off a friend s hands. ',China
' How come he always comes to you  He loves you more but he s supposed to be my pet she d pout. That was until the day I came home and was met once again by that familiar grin. ',China

' At the end of the year Shanghai Culture Square the city s leading musical theater is presenting four major Western musicals a testament to how Shanghai has become China s most vibrant market for such productions. ',China
' Tony Award winning musical The Producers started its China tour on Nov 1 with a two week run in Shanghai. A total of 100 shows have been scheduled to take place across Chinese cities including Beijing Guangzhou Hangzhou and Macao. ',China
' The other three productions are West Side Story Legally Blonde and Mozart l opera rock. ',China
' We have developed this tradition of bringing heavyweight shows to the city at the end of the year when people are in the mood for fun and are ready to spend said Fei Yuanhong artistic director of Shanghai Culture Square a State owned company responsible for the theater operation as well as bringing in and creating performances. ',China
' Our productions include a classical masterpiece an Americanstyle comedy and a French tragedy so there is something for everybody. ',China
' Broadway productions debuted in China in 2002. The first musical that was shown was the well loved epic Les Miserable which had a three week run at the Shanghai Grand Theater. ',China
' In the following years Shanghai Grand Theater presented a major Broadway production every year including Mamma Mia The Phantom of the Opera and The Lion King. These shows were so popular with audiences that the city decided to build a new theater dedicated to musical performances. ',China
' Established in 2011 Shanghai Culture Square has since become the city s premier location for musicals. Apart from Broadway performances the venue has also hosted German French and Chinese productions. ',China
' To promote their offerings Shanghai Culture Square organizes regular lectures and workshops that accompany a performance as well as public engagement activities. Earlier this year when Shanghai Culture Square announced that it would be showing Legally Blonde the theater held a casting event for dogs. ',China
' The production requires two dog actors. This is the first time our theater will have dogs acting in a musical so we came up with the idea of auditioning for dogs. It was a fun event and quite a successful promotion campaign for the play though we didn t find the right dog actors said Fei. ',China
' Shanghai Culture Square eventually bought two dogs for the job and had them trained by professional coaches. ',China
' One of the puppies a Chihuahua named Bruiser after its character in the play has been living in the theater to adjust to the crowd and noise. It has become popular among those queuing to buy tickets at the theater. ',China

' SHANGHAI  For those who have read and feel drawn by the romance of Provence France its vineyards famed bouillabaisse restaurants its chateaux and lavender fields of its countryside an exhibition on at the Shanghai Museum may be of interest. ',China
' The Marseilles Art in the 18th and 19th Centuries which runs until June 30 at the museum features 131 works from six major museums in Marseilles capital of the former French province of Provence. ',China
' Both the French and Chinese curators anticipate the exhibition will prove very popular. ',China
' The Mediterranean port has long been one of the most famous foreign cities among Chinese even more familiar than Paris to many because it was the birthplace of the revolutionary song La Marseillaise which became the French national anthem. ',China
' The flaw in the exhibition is that it gives visitors the general impression that Marseilles had merely mediocre art in the 18th and 19th centuries when in fact it can rightfully boast a rich history both in terms of art and many other things. ',China
' Art lovers in metropolitan Shanghai and Beijing used to be satisfied with merely a show of foreign art but that was a decade ago said Zhou Minxi a local investment banker who was visiting the museum with his girlfriend ahead of a planned trip to the south of France. ',China
' They need to show us some really good pieces and I know they have many I was twice there he added. ',China
' The past year s have seen art and culture lovers in China disappointed by exhibitions with an impressive title but not so impressive exhibits. ',China
' For instance the Renaissance and Baroque Art show at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing last October with the exception of five small sketches by masters like Leonardo da Vinci for the most part featured sketches by little known renaissance and baroque artists. ',China
' And the Picasso s Art exhibition last April in the capital which launched a huge media campaign offered its enthusiastic visitors only a small selection of the artist s woodprints. ',China
' Curators of the Marseilles Art show have been more careful in their choice of selected pieces to represent France s second largest city and which recently celebrated its 2600 birthday. ',China
' The exhibition is divided into four sections sculptures sketches oils and costumes and home furnishings. ',China
' And in spite of the dearth of important works it is still worth a visit because for some of the interesting pieces on display. ',China
' A sketched entitled Portrait of a Maiden captures the delicate moment a maiden gives a shy smile. ',China
' Another entitled A Loose Woman portrays the Madonna as a lovely blooming flower. ',China
' There is also a plaster sculpture depicting a graceful nude threading a needle. ',China
' The highlight of the show is a replica of a living room at Borely Castle. The ceramics carpets furniture and oil paintings in the room tell the life of the Borely family in the 18th century. ',China
' Today the castle and its grounds covering 135 acres form the largest public park in Marseille. It is home to a rose garden a landscaped garden and a botanical garden. ',China
' Museums in Marseilles including Borely Castle are known around the world for their art collections by old masters such as Rubens Corot Millet Ingres and David and contemporary masterpieces by Balthus Masson Marquet Ernst Derain and also numerous exquisite ceramics which once decorated the tables of the 18th and 19th century local gentry.

' With deep insights into marital adversity male methods of taming female ambitions and bargaining over love and money the bitter comedy is full of irony and understanding of human weaknesses. ',China

' It tells the story of the humble chair and its incalculable impact on human life through the centuries. Its premiere at the London International Mime Festival in January 2005 was a sellout. ',China
' Since its founding in 1979 Tricicle has exported its productions to the great theatre capitals of the world London New York Paris and Buenos Aires and toured extensively elsewhere following its fantastic reception at the Barcelona Olympics as the special guest ensemble. ',China
' The three artists  creative approach has contributed to the forming of a new genre a mixture of silent movie clown technique mime and conventional theatre. ',China

' There are layers of meanings to the best films novels and plays and we find our own points of significance in these works by cultural re imagining. ',China
' Director James Cameron s Avatar is sweeping cinemas around the globe like a tsunami. Here you have to book in advance or wait in long lines   and the only shows with tickets available are for odd hours. ',China
' Groundbreaking special effects aside the 3D movie has the themes of fighting colonialism indiscriminate use of military forces and interracial relationships. But the moment the giant bulldozer appeared on screen I had an aha epiphany  This movie is about today s China or more accurately there is a specific Chinese interpretation. ',China
' Avatar is or could be seen as a parable about the fight of ordinary people against the all engulfing greed of real estate developers. In Chinese parlance the Na vi would be called nail houses people who refuse to give up their legally owned properties. They protect their rights and houses   or trees in this case   and stick out like nails amid a field of debris. ',China
' I m sure Cameron did not get his inspiration from the plight of Chinese nails. He was obviously referring to the wars George W Bush launched in the Middle East. But I m not the only Chinese person who twisted this tale to fit our paradigm. ',China
' For example when the Na vi shoot arrows at the heavy machinery that crushes everything in its path the scene that instantly come to my mind was the Shanghai woman surnamed Pan who used a homemade Molotov cocktail to thwart the rumbling bulldozers   albeit in vain. When the Na vi hold a vigil reminiscent of the Zhang Yimou directed Olympic Opening Ceremony the sense of foreboding is so pervasive that I cannot help but think of Tang Fuzhen the Chengdu woman who resorted to self immolation to protest against forced eviction. ',China
' I wouldn t be surprised if the authorities put a stop to the screening of this massive blockbuster   when too many people as I do read into it a connection with a reality that s too close for comfort. But they cannot blame Cameron for inciting unrest among a restive populace unable to hold on to their rights of abode. ',China
' Such is the nature of cross cultural message relays. People of one culture read into the works of another culture meanings unintended. With reasonable arguments these interpretations can add layers to the work and bring relevance to a new audience. It is quite different from a failure to understand the author s original meaning. Most educated Chinese get the message Cameron embedded in the fantasy tale but it does not resonate with us as much as the developers vs landowner angle. ',China
' In my line of work I encounter these kinds of problems every day. I am a consultant for several organizations in the business of importing foreign books movies TV shows and events. Apart from the factor of name recognition I ask myself and those who seek my counsel  Does it have a Chinese angle  Can the target audience relate to the issues  ',China
' One work that clicked with Beijing audiences was Jane Eyre. Wildly popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s when China opened its doors to Western influence the classic story about a young governess and her rocky romance with her employer faded on dusty shelves when foreign books were no longer taboo. ',China
' Last year the National Center for the Performing Arts had two runs of Jane Eyre. It dawned on me this tale really strikes home today. Jane is not beautiful she is not rich the man who is willing to marry her has a castle. Yet she walks away from the wedding because he has a wife. ',China
' Now contrast it with Dwelling Narrowness a recent TV show so popular it was banned   a woman uses her beauty to become a concubine for the sole purpose of getting a decent apartment. What would she think of Jane Eyre  Nuts probably. Edward Rochester could have got a full house of concubines. ',China
' You see Jane Eyre is poignant because it is a perfect counterpoint to Dwelling Narrowness and the harsh reality it depicts. In both Avatar and Jane Eyre you can detect the real issues that grip China   an emerging middle class made up of those in their late 20s and early 30s blocked out from affordable housing and an army of property owners in a losing battle against developers and the interests they represent. More irony  The latter group is robbed so that more houses can be built and the former gourp has to buy them at prices so high they are essentially robbed for life. ',China
' With house prices skyrocketing across the country housing is such a big problem that even a domestic release was reinterpreted through this prism. The Founding of a Republic an epic made to celebrate the 60th anniversary of New China was ruthlessly dissected by irreverent young writer Han Han. He pointed out that Madame Soong Ching ling s support of the Communist Party hinged on her ability to retain her mansion in downtown Shanghai a point partly supported by a line in the movie that a Communist leader said she could keep her house. ',China
' When I mounted The Sound of Music in Beijing 12 years ago one of my concerns was the seven kids. ',China
' China has a family planning policy. Most urban families have only one kid. Would they accept one with seven  Would it be outlandish  ',China
' No I was not engaged in self censorship. I was zooming in on those discrepancies the audience may have with the work. Even without the policy most Chinese families would not want more than two kids. A horde of siblings is not something urban children   our target audience   take for granted. ',China
' Fortunately the musical does not focus on sibling dynamics. The seven kids act no differently from schoolmates. Besides the plot was already so familiar many probably did not even think of it. But it was a legitimate point. Most sitcom families in America have three children. How can you map out storylines in a Chinese television show centered around a family  ',China
' Home with Kids a hit sitcom in China tackled this dilemma with ingenuity. The wife had a previous marriage so she has a son. The husband has a daughter from a previous marriage and he also has a younger son who was born in the United States. So it is still a family of three kids all born legally. ',China
' A family sitcom with one child would be a daunting task for the scriptwriters. ',China
' Most people grow up in one culture and have trained themselves to look at things from a certain angle. Their way of thinking and doing things is what makes culture unique. ',China
' But to broaden the appeal of a cultural work it is often necessary to tone down that specificity so that people from other cultures may search and find their own relevancies. That means distilling the complexities and uniqueness to a few broad issues. Hollywood is a master at that. It often dumbs down too much leaving a few cut and dried cliches. ',China
' Avatar may not have much depth but it inadvertently hits a nerve in a country where the bulldozer is a sign of both progress and threat. ',China

' Joint efforts of various industries needed to lift cutting edge solutions out of a  trough of disillusionment  ',China
' The artificial intelligence industry is in a trough of disillusionment as efforts are needed to solve many problems such as beefing up the supply of computer algorithms so AI can be used in different industries at scale industry experts said. ',China
' Trough of disillusionment is a term created by market research company Gartner Inc as part of a graphical presentation to represent the maturity adoption and social application of specific technologies. Trough of disillusionment happens when interest in the technology wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver on the hype the industry has created. ',China
' After going through rapid development for the past five to six years the AI industry is sliding into a deep water zone. Entrepreneurs investors and media are all lowering their previous high anticipation toward AI said Yin Qi co founder and CEO of Megvii a Chinese artificial intelligence unicorn. ',China
' Such views are echoed by many in the AI industry. ',China
' Duane Kuang the founding managing partner of Qiming Venture Partners said every investor was enthusiastic about AI years ago. As long as startups come with the label AI they were given a high valuation. ',China
' Now there are more and more AI companies. Although no one doubts the value of AI everyone is beginning to ponder over the true value of AI companies Kuang said. ',China
' This is a necessary stage for a technology to mature. Developers of the technology either shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters Gartner said. ',China
' The trough of disillusionment for AI could last 18 to 24 months. Only companies that can apply AI to solve industrial problems at scale can survive the stage and emerge stronger said Yin who co founded the computer vision technology provider nine years ago. ',China
' The 32 year old senior executive said many problems are blocking AI from truly delivering its value including insufficient supply of computer algorithms and the difficulty and high cost in applying algorithms to different industries at scale. ',China
' As AI is increasingly used in supermarkets smartphones and other scenarios some thought that AI algorithms have become very easy now. The fact though is that its supply is far from enough Yin said. ',China
' Compared to application scenarios  demands for AI algorithms its supply is less than 1 percent Yin said. ',China
' That is especially the case when it comes to facial recognition technology s application industries such as in transportation and finance which have stringent demand for precision security and safety. ',China
' To solve these problems Megvii has established the world s largest computer vision research institute. It houses more than 500 full time researchers to focus on better algorithms. ',China
' The company has also developed its proprietary deep learning framework MegEngine and its AI productivity platform Brain  which can enable algorithm training at scale. ',China
' The company announced in March that it would open source MegEngine making the platform accessible to developers across the globe. ',China
' To accelerate the industrial application of AI Megvii has focused resources in offering full stack AI solutions across three verticals in the personal internet of things city IoT and supply chain IoT. ',China
' With its technology being increasingly used in smartphones retail and city management Megvii upgraded its strategy to include supply chain management last year to help drive forward digital transformation. It unveiled a system called Hetu to boost efficiency in the logistics sector in January 2019. ',China
' Megvii s AI enabled temperature screening solution has been widely deployed during the COVID 19 outbreak in subway stations universities shopping malls and other places across China to help contain the epidemic. ',China
' Other AI companies such as SenseTime are also working hard to boost the industrial application of their technologies. ',China
' Xu Li co founder and CEO of SenseTime said with the advancement of AI the technology should not only address major problems but also a list of long tail issues. That is why an open system of algorithms is vital. ',China
' In July SenseTime announced the upgrade of the company s indigenous OpenMMLab an open source AI algorithm system to cover over 100 algorithms and 600 pre trained models so that more industries can jump on the AI bandwagon. ',China

' We can play in the water and snow here in the hot summer. It s a great place to relax and have parties said Wu Shu who visited the park with her friends. ',China

' More than 50 technology companies and organizations including Apple Amazon Microsoft and Facebook filed an amicus brief on Monday in support of lawsuits against the Trump administration s suspension of work visas. ',China
' The President s suspension of nonimmigrant visa programs supposedly to  protect  American workers actually harms those workers their employers and the economy the companies argued in the brief. ',China
' US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation in April suspending the entry of nearly all immigrants to the US due to the high unemployment rate. He issued another proclamation in June extending the April order through the end of this year and expanding it by imposing new restrictions on a variety of work visas. ',China
' The June proclamation targets H 1B visas for highly skilled workers H 2B guest worker visas J trainee visas and L intracompany transferee visas. Trump claimed the measure will free up half a million jobs for US workers displaced by the coronavirus pandemic. ',China
' A diverse set of parties including the US Chamber of Commerce the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation have filed lawsuits in California and Washington federal courts to challenge the president s orders. ',China
' Twenty two states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus  friend of the court  brief in support of the suits on Aug 7 warning that the visa ban could result in economic fallout. ',China
' Those tech companies joined the efforts arguing in their brief that the indiscriminate suspension of these crucial nonimmigrant visas programs does not further the interests of the United States. ',China
' Specifically the proclamations will stifle innovation hinder growth and ultimately harm US workers businesses and the economy more broadly in irreparable ways according to the brief. ',China
' Julie Pearl CEO of the Pearl Law Group in San Francisco and a member of the Alliance of Business Immigration Lawyers echoed that by saying the unilateral presidential orders will stifle economic recovery and growth apart from violating the Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality and Administrative Procedure Acts. She said that is the reason why her group signed on to support litigation countering the orders. ',China
' The rationale for this petty order is the myth that this pipeline of people takes jobs away from Americans. This fiction has been disproven in multiple studies said Pearl. In fact while new data from USCIS  US Citizenship and Immigration Services  shows that H 1B visa holders are less than half of a percent of full time workers in the US they are perhaps a major engine for job creation and economic recovery. ',China
' Research by the American Immigration Council has shown that 1.3 million new jobs and approximately  158 billion in GDP could be created by 2045 if we simply increase H 1B visas she said. ',China
' One study by the council found that 231224 more jobs would have been created for US born workers in a two year period just by raising the number of H 1B visas from their current 85000 per year cap to meet market demand. ',China
' The reason is simple  Foreign born workers have an outsized impact on US innovation with 30 percent of US patents filed by immigrants. Over 50 percent of US patents are now going to foreign companies and pushing more genius minds offshore will increase this number   along with the jobs that would have been created stateside said Pearl citing the US Patent and Trademark Office s data. ',China
' Shortly after Trump signed the proclamation in June tech companies like Apple and Google opposed the move. ',China
' Immigrants have not only fueled technological breakthroughs and created new businesses and jobs but have also enriched American life Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in June. America s continued success depends on companies having access to the best talent from around the world. Particularly now we need that talent to help contribute to America s economic recovery.

' Apple CEO Tim Cook said that he was deeply disappointed by the guest worker ban. Like Apple this nation of immigrants has always found strength in our diversity and hope in the enduring promise of the American Dream Cook tweeted in June. ',China

' The environment for rural innovation and entrepreneurship will be improved by means of a plan released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on July 17 that outlined a comprehensive set of goals regarding the development of rural industries. ',China
' Those goals include raising to 15 million the number of people returning to rural areas by 2025 to build startups. In recent years that number has been increasing by 1 million each year and reached 8.5 million nationwide by the end of 2019 according to the ministry. ',China
' Zeng Yande chief of the ministry s rural industry development department said analysis shows that these targets are within reach. ',China
' Migrant workers going back to the countryside for job opportunities has become a new trend he said. Equipped with an understanding of both urban and rural areas exposure to industrialization as well as internet skills they will play a strong role in advancing rural industries. ',China
' Potentially deepening the trend is the tough job market induced by the COVID 19 epidemic. Data released by the ministry in mid June shows that 23 million migrant workers were temporarily stuck in the countryside amid the outbreak and 600000 of them had expressed their intent to stay home longer to establish their own businesses. ',China
' The pressure on hiring is likely to be long lasting especially for out of towners. According to the National Bureau of Statistics the surveyed unemployment rate for migrant workers in June went up by 0.7 percentage points year on year while overall urban employment rose by 0.6 percentage points year on year. ',China
' Wu Zhenjun a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council s rural economic research office said during an interview with China Economic Times that with the implementation of China s rural revitalization strategy that has already been drawing people to their rural hometowns damper job prospects will lead to a further increase in returning migrant workers including those stranded in home villages and those forced to return after failing to land stable jobs elsewhere. ',China
' These workers have accumulated a certain amount of both human and social capital and are bound to become a significant force in rejuvenating the countryside he said. ',China
' At Wang s company about half of the 50 new employees this year are likely to be migrant workers returning from the village. ',China
' A rising number of my fellow villagers have decided to work closer to home due to shuttered factories in cities or interrupted transportation he said. ',China
' Xu Jisheng head of the commerce bureau in Dangshan county added that this year the majority of the newly unemployed have opted for service sector jobs closer to home or have dived into rural e commerce businesses. ',China
' For those who set their sights on forming new enterprises they need infrastructure such as innovation parks as well as resources including suitable financial products and experienced tutors who can offer targeted guidance he said. ',China

' Zhu Hong village chief of Jiangsu province s Shanlian village which has gained fame for eliminating poverty through developing rural tourism said that counseling from industry leaders and government led assistance will prove invaluable in helping local villagers weather disruptions caused by the viral epidemic and potential future emergencies.

' One lesson we have learned from the COVID 19 outbreak is that we should have an emergency plan or mechanism in place to offer advice during difficult times she said. For instance since the disease outbreak has sapped demand we have encouraged local villagers to use idle time to learn more about social media promotion and have invited experts to give crash courses on that. ',China
' Shanlian also set up an association comprising different branches focusing on rural restaurants rural hotels and crop planting. ',China

' Visitors look at descriptions of AI chips developed by Huawei and Qualcomm during an AI conference in Shanghai.  Photo by Long Wei For China Daily  ',China
' Qualcomm Inc s lobbying efforts to get US government approval to sell chips for Huawei s 5G phones show that no company is willing to sacrifice a huge market for political reasons and achieving win win outcomes is the best solution industry experts said on Tuesday. ',China
' Qualcomm s move clearly indicates that imposing restrictions on a slew of Chinese tech companies including Huawei Technologies Co will bring no benefits for US counterparts except for sharp revenue losses said Wang Peng an associate professor at the Hillhouse Academy of the Renmin University of China. ',China
' Businesses across the world will not sacrifice cooperation and winwin results for the sake of biased political reasons he said. ',China
' The comments came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is lobbying the US government to revoke restrictions on sale of components. The US restrictions have virtually handed Qualcomm s foreign competitors a market that is worth as much as  8 billion annually they said. ',China
' If Qualcomm is subject to export licensing but its foreign competitors are not the US government policy will cause a rapid shift in the 5G chipset market share in China and beyond the US company said. ',China
' Industry experts said that the so called foreign competitors are MediaTek and South Korea s Samsung. Under the US restrictions Huawei is reported to have signed a letter of intent for sourcing 120 million chipsets from MediaTek which according to some industry insiders will help MediaTek surpass Qualcomm in chipset sales in terms of market share. ',China
' Daniel Jiang Han senior researcher from market consultancy Pangoal said that it is not easy for many key electronic component manufacturers to leave the Chinese market as it is one of the largest manufacturing powerhouses in the world with a complete industry chain. ',China
' For Qualcomm it makes good business sense to continue shipments to Huawei as it already has a long term licensing agreement with Huawei he said. ',China
' In July Qualcomm said it has settled a patent dispute with Huawei under which the latter will pay it  1.8 billion in back royalties owed for 2019 and for the first six months of this year under a new global patent license agreement. ',China
' The US government put Huawei in an Entity List in May 2019 and said US firms are required to obtain a license before exporting domestically produced chips and software. In May this year Washington expanded these rules by requiring contract chip producers anywhere in the world that use US semiconductor equipment and technology to obtain its approval before producing chips designed by Huawei s subsidiary HiSilicon. ',China
' Speaking at a conference earlier this month Richard Yu president of Huawei s consumer unit termed the halt on production of Huawei designed Kirin premium chips as a very big loss and said 2020 may be the last year for the Kirin high end chips due to US sanctions. ',China
' Canalys said Huawei is still subject to US government restrictions which have affected its business outside of the Chinese mainland. Its overseas shipments fell by 27 percent from April to June this year. ',China
' However the company continued to dominate the domestic market and boosted its Chinese shipments by 8 percent in the second quarter. Huawei currently sells over 70 percent of its smartphones in the Chinese mainland. ',China
' There is a huge gap between Chinese chipset and other key electronics manufacturers and world leading companies in terms of technologies. But it does not mean that the country cannot move into the fast lane said Wang from the Renmin University of China. ',China
' With more orders moving to local companies Chinese firms in the field will gather more attention and investment which they will further leverage for the research and development of core technologies he said. ',China

' According to the plan the pilot projects will last three years. ',China
' In the wake of a year on year decline in China s foreign trade during the first half imports and exports in service trade excluding travel service rose 2.1 percent showing huge exterior demand and growth potential said Li Jun director of the international trade in services institute of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. ',China
' In contrast to merchandise trade trade in services refers to the sale and delivery of intangible products such as transportation tourism telecommunications construction advertising computing and accounting. ',China
' In June 2018 the State Council approved a two year pilot program to deepen pilot projects for the innovative development of the service trade in 17 cities and regions. ',China
' Previously 17 pilot regions  service trade accounted for more than 70 percent of the total. The expanded service trade pilot project will play an important role in promoting service trade and ensuring stability in foreign investment and foreign trade Li said. ',China
' Among the 11 newly added pilot regions central and western cities have a relatively high proportion accounting for more than 60 percent. ',China
' Central and western regions have their unique advantage in developing the service trade Li said. Compared with coastal areas they have lower cost in land and human resources. In addition local governments have unveiled measures to attract investment and develop the service trade. With increasing facilitation of transportation and logistics central and western regions  advantage in developing the service trade have become even more prominent. ',China
' China s service trade totaled 2.23 trillion yuan   315.2 billion  during the January June period down 14.7 percent year on year data from the Ministry of Commerce showed. The country s service exports outperformed imports in recent months with the service trade deficit narrowing 46.1 percent from the same period last year to 401.7 billion yuan in H1. ',China
' During the first six months China s trade of knowledge intensive services increased 9.2 percent year on year to 974.43 billion yuan accounting for 43.7 percent of total trade in services. ',China
' Among them exports of knowledge intensive services rose by 9.7 percent to 512.87 billion yuan accounting for 56.2 percent of the total. Intellectual property payments insurance services telecom computer and information services maintained faster growth with year on year growth of 37.2 18.7 and 15.2 percent respectively. ',China
' Talking about the future of service trade Li said over a long period China had higher service trade deficits in tourism education and healthcare. In the future the country should put more efforts to narrow the service trade deficit in these sectors and enhance industrial competitiveness. ',China
' China also has strong international competitiveness in construction engineering contracting and computer software. In the future the country will further make use of those strengths and improve the quantity and quality of service trade Li added. ',China

' Performers show signs of the China International Fair for Trade in Services in the Wangfujing pedestrian street in Beijing capital of China Aug. 4 2020.  Xinhua Ren Chao  ',China
' While trade exchanges and cooperation among countries were hard hit by COVID 19 China one of the countries taking the lead in the economic recovery is set to open the first large scale offline international trade fair in the country since the outbreak of the pandemic reaffirming its commitment to wider opening up and offering a glance at global trade in the post pandemic era. ',China
' As one of the world s largest comprehensive fairs for trade in services the China International Fair for Trade in Services  CIFTIS  is scheduled to be held in Beijing in early September and has prepared both online and offline events due to the global pandemic situation. As of last Tuesday 141 international organizations embassies in China commerce associations and institutions were expected to participate in the event in addition to over 2000 Chinese and foreign enterprises. ',China
' At a time when uncertainties of the pandemic remain an overhang for the recovery of the world economy organizing such a large scale trade fair is yet another example of China s capability in controlling the spread of the virus and its resolution of sticking to the opening up policy in the post pandemic era. ',China
' It is not surprising though that some may question such a stance when global demand slumps due to the impact of COVID 19. When a recent political bureau meeting underscored a new development pattern known as dual circulation which takes the domestic market as the mainstay while lets domestic and foreign markets boost each other some misread it as a sign of less interaction with foreign markets. ',China
' In fact together with two other major exhibition platforms for China s opening up    China Import and Export Fair  Canton Fair  and China International Import Expo  CIIE  the CIFTIS speaks for the strategy of the country. ',China
' China has deeply integrated itself into globalization. It cannot expand domestic demand without international cooperation and smooth operation of the global value chain. Expanding domestic demand on the other hand can tap the potential of the massive consumer market and at the same time benefit foreign businesses. ',China
' China remains one of the top three investment destinations for 63 percent of respondents in a survey conducted earlier this year by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and global consultancy firm Roland Berger. ',China
' It is a pity that while China steps up its efforts to reinvigorate international exchanges and cooperation some U.S. politicians violate market principles and abuse national security concepts to wantonly suppress non American businesses clouding the outlook for the subdued world economy in dire need of the revival of trade activities. This is disruptive to the trust and norms the international community has built up over many years and those politicians will never get their way. ',China
' China s rapid development over the decades benefited from interactions and cooperation with countries around the world and has in turn provided other countries with sustained growth impetus and important opportunities. The key to success lies in a true commitment to opening up and such a commitment remains effective and will continue to benefit the world in the future. Enditem ',China

' Trump again presses schools to reopen promises 125 million masks ',China
' U.S. President Donald Trump is repeating his call for the nation s schools to reopen and has again pressed Congress to steer future coronavirus funding away from schools that stay closed this fall. ',China
' Trump made the remarks on Wednesday at a White House discussion with parents teachers and doctors who said they support a full return to the classroom. ',China
' Also joining Trump were Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Vice President Mike Pence who said the health risks tied to keeping children at home are greater than those associated with the coronavirus. ',China
' Trump has repeatedly pushed for schools to reopen saying there are low risks to young people from the virus even as teachers and public health experts have raised alarms about whether it could be done safely. ',China
' Fifty nine percent of voters oppose the call for schools and colleges to fully open according to a new Politico Morning Consult poll up from 53 percent last month. ',China
' Bloomberg reported on Thursday that many schools that followed the president s advice to reopen fully are now seeing hundreds of students staff and teachers put into quarantine. Despite Trump s efforts most of the country s largest school districts have said they would start the school year with online classes. ',China
' Speaking at a White House briefing earlier on Wednesday Trump released eight recommendations for reopening U.S. schools including that masks be used when social distancing is not possible. ',China

' Chinese scientist led team discovers earliest protocluster ',China
'  ECNS     A research project initiated by the University of Science and Technology of China  USTC  involving astronomers from China the United States and Chile has discovered the earliest protocluster known to date in the Universe the university announced on Tuesday. ',China
' LAGER z7OD1 as the earliest protocluster is called was discovered in the Lyman Alpha Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization  LARGE  project according to the research team. Astronomers found this protocluster in data from the Dark Energy Camera on a four meter Telescope at the CTIO observatory in Chile. ',China
' Using Magellan Telescope in Chile the team confirmed it is the earliest known protocluster identified by spectroscopic measurements and that the Universe is only 770 million years old. Besides the total volume of ionized bubbles generated by its member galaxies was found to be comparable to that of the protocluster indicating the merging of ionized bubbles to form giant equivalents. ',China
' After the Big Bang the Universe cooled down and entered the Dark Ages. With the formation of the first stars and galaxies their ultraviolet photons began to ionize the surrounding neutral hydrogen forming ionized bubbles gradually turning the Universe transparent and thus ending the Dark Ages. This overall phase change process in the early Universe is called Reionization. The observation of the cosmic reionization process and galaxies in this period is a very challenging task on the frontier of Astrophysics. ',China
' Astronomers expect galaxies in the Universe s Epoch of Reionization to be strong Lyman a emission line objects. ',China
' By searching the Lyman alpha emitting galaxies and analyzing the spatial distribution of galaxy candidates the LAGER team has discovered LAGER z7OD1 an over dense region of 21 narrowband selected Lyman alpha galaxies. ',China
' This discovery not only sets a redshift record but also provides an excellent observation target for further study of the cosmic reionization process and ionized bubbles. ',China
' The discovery was published in Nature Astronomy on Monday. ',China

' China is now showing its charm in the new era providing more chances and opportunities to the world and will be an attractive dreamland to the younger generations worldwide he said. ',China
' The State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs said it has records of overseas workers entering China about 3.3 million times in the past five years. ',China
' To attract more top overseas talent the administration has made joint efforts with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security as well as the Ministry of Public Security to simplify the visa application process from weeks to five days. Other preferential policies including lowering the threshold for permanent residence applicants also have been adopted. ',China
' Zhang Jianguo head of SAFEA said a more proactive open and effective policy on competent professionals will be pursued to further implement Xi s remarks in a report to the 19th CPC National Congress in October. ',China

' Zhang said applications for work permits for foreign experts whose skills are in urgent demand as well as top talent in all fields will be streamlined next year to attract more talent. ',China
' We ve seen great progress in policies to recruit more overseas talent and there will be more of them he said. Those preferential policies reveal the country s openness and inclusiveness which a great power should demonstrate to the world. ',China
' Apart from that first seminar five years ago Xi conducted two similar seminars with foreign experts   one in Shanghai in 2014 and the other in Moscow in 2015   showing the great value he places on foreign talent in China. ',China
' In May 2014 Xi met with 50 foreign experts in Shanghai and listened to their proposals ranging from reforming the talent evaluation system to better supporting innovation. ',China
' The president said the country must implement a more open policy for talented workers to bring in talent no matter where it comes from make the most use of it and trust it fully. China will always remain devoted to learning will learn modestly from the world no matter how well it develops and will openly enhance learning and exchanges with other countries he said. ',China
' Anthony J. Leggett a Nobel Prize winner in physics from Great Britain and now a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University said he was greatly impressed by the earnestness Xi showed at the meeting. He said he was especially impressed to see the president taking notes. President Xi knows the necessity of bringing in and fully using foreign expertise Leggett said. ',China
' Wang Huiyao founder of the think tank Center for China and Globalization said that Xi s remarks on foreign experts had shown the direction of the country s talent policy. ',China
' In such an era we should try to realize a Chinese dream that talent around the world could all come to China for a better development he wrote in an article published after the Shanghai seminar. ',China
' In May 2015 Xi also met in Moscow with about 40 Russians who once worked in China or their family members. Since 1978 tens of thousands of Russian experts have come to China and participated in its reform and opening up drive as well as its modernization. ',China

',China
' We have also arranged people who can speak Chinese language at the airport to ease the Chinese visitors said Deepak Raj Joshi chief executive officer of NTB. ',China
' Based on ongoing arrivals and booked seats in the airlines the NTB expects arrivals of at least 30000 Chinese tourists over the next two weeks. ',China
' This will be the major boost to Nepal tourism sector as Nepal expects at least 150000 Chinese tourists by air in 2018 according to NTB. Nepal received a total of 104664 Chinese tourists in 2017 according to Nepal s Department of Immigration. China is the second largest source market for Nepal s tourism sector. ',China
' Travel and tour operators said that Nepal could attract even more Chinese tourists during the Spring Festival if more flights are arranged between the two countries and more Chinese cities are connected with flights. ',China
' These Chinese airlines currently operate from Lhasa Kunming Chengdu and Guangzhou to Kathmandu but Chinese capital Beijing and major financial city Shanghai are still out of direct air connectivity with Nepal. ',China

' Wang Xingyu s first trip to the village of Jinlong last August was one of discovery. The 26 year old Wang drove about 20 hours from Shanghai to observe and study the small remote and isolated village in Huayuan county in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture in Central China s Hunan province which has about 600 ethnic Miao people. ',China
' And what Wang saw there the mountains rivers narrow lanes and wooden houses was in sharp contrast to New York where he lived from 2015 to 2017 while studying for his master s degree in international relations at New York University. ',China
' When I was abroad people would ask me questions about China such as  What is China like   I realized then that I could think only of big cities like Beijing Shanghai and Guangzhou. But that s not the whole picture of China because the population of rural areas is quite large. So I wanted to see what China was really like says Wang. ',China

' Eco friendly  hill stations  blossom in wake of visionary Naked resort pioneer in Zhejiang ',China
' White collar workers in big cities are turning to the natural beauty of the countryside on weekends to enjoy a break and decompress from the pressures of urban life in the process. ',China
' Deqing county in Zhejiang province which offers beautiful landscapes and other advantages in the heart of the Yangtze River Delta is a destination of choice for nearby urban residents. It takes less than two hours to drive to Deqing from Shanghai or Hangzhou the provincial capital. ',China
' Unlike others who offer homestays in small villages the farmers catering to tourists in Deqing describe what they do as agritainment a concept that has drawn foreign investors. Deqing s agritainment may cost more than elsewhere but it also features a higher level of service and a better tourist experience than most officials say. ',China
' The nightly room rate is over 1000 yuan   160  and you d better book months in advance said Wang Qinying head of the Deqing county government. ',China
' Guests at farms are mostly white collar workers both from home and abroad. ',China
' Grant Horsfield a South African businessman is the earliest developer of Deqing s agritainment industry. He is better known by locals as Gao Tiancheng. He came to Deqing in 2007. ',China
' A pioneer ',China
' Gao was born in a small village in South Africa s Western Cape province and didn t travel to a city until he was 12 years old. ',China
' I am actually the son of farmer he said in Chinese. Now he is the founder and chairman of Naked Group a luxury resort developer in China. ',China
' When he started his first business in South Africa 20 years ago he was asked in an interview about what he did and why. He answered  I hope to sit at a bar. Someone is talking about my product. They will be happy because I changed their life. ',China
' In 2005 Gao came to China as vice president of marketing for a South African investment company in Shanghai. Despite being well paid he always felt homesick for nature and the idyllic life that he had known since childhood. ',China
' There is more to life than just working Gao said. In his philosophy of life people are put on the earth to enjoy the wonderful things the creator made. By contrast he said the concrete jungle of Shanghai seems suffocating and meaningless. ',China
' In 2007 he determined that he would go back to South Africa. But a trip to Deqing s Mogan Mountain changed his mind. Lost on the mountain he bumped into a land of idyllic beauty a village called Laoling. There were only about 20 residents all elderly and many cottages had been abandoned as young people had left the hamlet. Yet the good environment and natural scenery made Gao feel at home and he soon saw a business opportunity. ',China
' If I could do something to be happy and also do some business that s a good thing he said. ',China
' He rented six cottages at 10000 yuan a year each for 15 years and started his first business in China homestays. The locals at the time thought Gao was completely mad. ',China
' After rebuilding the cottages with the help of his architect wife Delphine Yip who earned her master s degree at Harvard University the place become a popular holiday resort. Though a room costs more than 1500 yuan per night the resort is popular with customers from Shanghai and Hangzhou. ',China
' Later Gao built a luxury ecological resort Naked Stables in Deqing in 2009 which covers an area of 12600 square meters of mostly woodland. ',China
' The resort must protect the environment and especially the woods. So we just provide point to point construction land for the resort s villas. The rest of the land is rented to Gao Wang said. ',China
' Thirty villas were constructed using insulated panels. ',China
' The villas are built using a steel frame structure. The main materials were made in other cities and assembled here said Zhu Yan vice president of special relations in Naked Group. The houses can be dismantled without harming the woods. ',China
' It s the first time the construction technique has been used in China Zhu said. ',China
' Naked Stables opened in 2010 and it obtained LEED Platinum certification from the US Green Building Council in 2013. ',China
' For Gao the prime principle is that no one is allowed to harm his resort especially its environment. The buildings which combine African and Asian characteristics have made Naked Stables a resort distinct from others in Deqing. ',China
' In 2017 Gao s latest resort rose from a collapsed castle that was built by Scottish missionary Duncan Main in 1910. It was called Naked Castle. It took Gao four years to finish the project at a cost of more than 200 million yuan. Over the past 10 years Gao s Naked brand resorts have achieved fame nationwide. ',China
' Shannon Huang chief marketing officer for a French home furnishings company in Shanghai planned to enjoy a holiday at Naked Stables three years ago when her son was 3 months old. ',China
' It was a pity that we could not manage to book a room even days before my holiday she said. ',China
' At the end of February she and her small family were able to spend a night in Naked Castle for 4500 yuan. The rooms are expensive but I think it s worth it Huang said. ',China
' In her eyes Naked Castle is an ideal place to play with her son. ',China
' In the past when we thought about spending time with our 3 year old we would choose five star hotels with entertainment facilities for kids. Naked Castle is not that noisy and the kids have plenty of recreational activities to have fun. ',China

' Beijing s development and change has expanded well beyond the central business district but for photographers there are the sweeping lines of Zaha Hadid s Galaxy SOHO and the later Wangjing SOHO. Wangjing is an area to watch. Since the neighborhood is closer to Capital Airport there is more room for expansion with a host of new buildings completed or still rising. Similarly the high tech areas around Zhongguancun which once were countryside south of the Old Summer Palace. Such areas also provide quality modern living in environments that couldn t be more different from the city s earlier courtyard hutong dwellings. ',China
' Rail travel has been a lifetime passion for me. In 1987 I arrived at Beijing s main railway station and over the past three decades have witnessed quite stunning changes   both in the trains themselves and the railway stations. In July 1996 coming from Northeast China on a very rainy morning I stepped down onto a small open air station  Beijing South. Apart from the name there is no comparison to the vast modern and easy to use terminal where the world s fastest passenger trains whisk passengers to Shanghai in under five hours. ',China
' Again with transport infrastructure Beijing s main airport which was considerably expanded before the 2008 Olympics is now operating at capacity or even beyond  Next year 2019 it will be complemented by a vast new airport with eight runways in suburban Daxing southwest of downtown. ',China
' When I first came to Beijing 31 years ago it felt like everything moved slowly. Indeed with nine million bicycles on its streets the city had the reputation for the quietest rush hour in the world. Though bicycles are still present in the form of rentals the city s avenues have now been taken over by cars in ever increasing numbers   a situation I never thought I would come to witness. ',China
' So much has happened to Beijing since my first stay in 1987 at the Friendship Hotel in Haidian when horses were pulling carts on Zhongguancun South. As I write this it feels like I have only just started talking about the changes I have witnessed and documented in this city which has become my home and whose streets I walk daily. This is a city that has vastly modernized but one where I can still find great beauty and tranquility. ',China

' BEIJING    Next time when your kids ask you to bring them a star from the sky you don t have to shrug and walk away. Tell them to wait instead. ',China
' A group of Chinese scientists are mulling a bold idea to capture a small near Earth asteroid which might be a potential threat and bring it back to Earth to exploit its resources. ',China
' Sounds like science fiction but I believe it can be realized said Li Mingtao a researcher at the National Space Science Center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ',China
' Li and his team raised the audacious idea in a contest of innovative future technologies recently held in Shenzhen south China s Guangdong Province and entered the finals with another 59 projects. ',China
' The contest encouraged young Chinese scientists to conceive groundbreaking technologies and trigger innovation. ',China
' The process could start with a spacecraft carrying a huge bag to wrap a small asteroid and push it back over the Earth. Then it would unfold a heat shield to reduce the velocity of the asteroid when it enters the Earth s atmosphere and control it to safely land in a no human zone Li explained. ',China
' Huang Wei chief engineer at an institute of the China Academy of Space Technology said the idea is very creative and could help promote the development of space technologies. ',China
' Li said many key technologies would have to be tackled to achieve the goal. One challenge would be finding a suitable target. The smaller an asteroid the more difficult it is to discover. Telescopes on the ground can only find small asteroids when they come very close. ',China
' Li is working with space engineers at the Qian Xuesen Laboratory of Space Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation to draw up a plan for a satellite constellation on the heliocentric Venus like orbit. The satellites will be used to search for and analyze near Earth small celestial bodies with a diameter around 10 meters. ',China
' He said the hardest challenge might be the control of the asteroid after it enters the Earth s atmosphere. They must design a heat shield and drop the speed of the asteroid from 12.5 km per second to about 140 meters per second before it touches down at a designated area. ',China
' To analyze the feasibility of the plan Li s team has targeted a small asteroid more than 100 million km away. It s about 6.4 meters in diameter and weighs several hundred tonnes. ',China
' The asteroid s main components are still not clear and need more observation and analysis to determine. Li calculated the proper time to launch an asteroid catcher would be 2029 and it could be brought back to Earth in 2034. ',China
' Some near Earth asteroids are at risk of colliding with Earth. An asteroid entered the Earth s atmosphere over Russia in February 2013 and exploded above Chelyabinsk leaving more than 1500 people injured and about 3000 buildings damaged. ',China
' Many scientists believe the extinction of dinosaurs was caused by the collision of an asteroid or a comet with the Earth. ',China
' However many asteroids contain resources with great scientific and economic values. The study of the formation and evolution of asteroids might shed light on the origins of the solar system as well as the origins of life and water on Earth. ',China
' NASA is reportedly planning to launch a spacecraft in 2022 which is due to arrive at an asteroid named Psyche in 2026. More than 95 percent of Psyche appears to be made of iron nickel and other metals such as gold platinum and copper. ',China
' Space mining might become a new engine for the global economy said Li. ',China
' So far the United States and Japan have landed probes on asteroids. Japan has brought back a sample. ',China
' After sending a probe to Mars in 2020 China plans to explore asteroids and even land on one to conduct scientific research. ',China
' Unlike missions to bring samples back we aim to bring back a whole asteroid weighing several hundred tonnes which could turn asteroids with a potential threat to Earth into usable resources said Li. ',China
' Li 36 began dreaming of space when he was growing up in the countryside. He liked gazing at the stars and watching meteors flying across the sky. He studied spacecraft design at university. ',China
' After joining the National Space Science Center he took part in China s space science programs and helped design the trajectory for the Chang e 2 probe to the second Lagrange point of the Sun Earth system. The probe is China s farthest flying spacecraft. ',China
' Li often talked with colleagues about whether they could predict the landing points of shooting stars. ',China
' One day an idea struck him  why not catch an asteroid and control it to land at a designated area  ',China
' Our analysis shows that maneuvering a small asteroid is feasible in principle and could bring enormous economic and social benefits said Li. ',China
' Preventing the danger of near Earth asteroids will also help secure the shared future of mankind he added. ',China

' The botched restoration of a 1000 year old Buddha statue in Southwest China has sparked widespread shock and ridicule after photos of its cartoonish color scheme surfaced online. ',China
' The relic was splashed with bright red blue and yellow paint making the circle behind Buddha s head look more like a lollipop or dartboard than a halo. ',China
' The Buddha is located in Anyue county in Southwest China s Sichuan province and dates back to the Song Dynasty  960 1279  according to CNR. ',China
' The restoration work was proposed and completed back in 1995 by local villagers who lacked knowledge on cultural relic conservation the Anyue county government said in a statement on its official Weibo account addressing the viral photo. By the time the government noticed the project was already finished the statement went on to say. ',China
' After the incident the Administration of Cultural Heritage improved the management and protection of other relics it added. No similar repair work was carried out again in recent years. ',China
' The incident was initially posted in a before and after photo by Xu Xin on Weibo a narrator who works at the Yulin Buddhist cave temple site at the Dunhuang grottoes in Northwest China s Gansu province one of the country s most celebrated sites for cultural relics. ',China
' Condemning the catastrophic restorative efforts the post echoed a storm of criticism on social media. ',China

' Harbin China s northernmost metropolis in Heilongjiang province seeks to build an international aviation hub and attract more international routes officials and experts said Thursday. ',China
' A Harbin international aviation hub is one of 10 international aviation hubs determined by the State during the nation s 13th Five Year Plan  2016 20  and the only one in the northeastern region said Li Haitao executive vice  governor of Heilongjiang province adding that the provincial government is determined to develop the hub as an accelerator to revive China s northeastern region. ',China
' He also noted that it is a way for Heilongjiang to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative and the China Mongolia Russia economic corridor. ',China
' It will be significant to form an airway and economic corridor between China s northwestern region even Asia s northeastern area and North America. It is also Harbin s strategic choice to further open up he said. ',China
' Because of its geographic advantage the aviation transport distance between Harbin and North America is the shortest among all Chinese cities even those in the southeastern region said Yao Jinjin a researcher from the China Academy of Civil Aviation Science and Technology. ',China
' If a plane departs from Harbin and traverses the polar region to the United States it will reduce three hours compared to flights leaving Beijing and also save fuel costs of up to 150000 yuan   21828  Yao said. ',China
' The route has potential in the market  she said. ',China
' Harbin Taiping International Airport operates 185 routes including 19 international ones. ',China

' CIVITA DI BAGNOREGIO Italy   For more and more Chinese tourists who are willing to explore unique scenery other than follow the traditional routes of grand capitals the hilltop village of Civita di Bagnoregio in central Italy has become a popular holiday destination. ',China
' About 130 km north of Rome Civita di Bagnoregio in Italian region of Lazio is actually composed of two parts  Bagnoregio with around 3800 residents and Civita the main attraction with a year round residents of seven. ',China
' At first glance the spectacular setting of Civita may take your breath. It perches on a plateau of volcanic rock overlooking the Tiber river valley. In foggy days the towering bell tower and other picturesque medieval buildings look like floating in the air and people aptly call it castle in the sky. ',China
' Founded more than 2500 years ago by the Etruscans the whole village is twined with narrow cobblestone streets where flowering plants dot the vine covered stone houses with bars or restaurants hidden among them. ',China
' CHINESE TOURISTS  PASSION ',China
' Local residents are very pleased to see tourists from all over the world among whom Chinese tourists are a very important group Roberto Pomi communication official of the municipality of Bagnoregio told Xinhua. ',China
' However suffering from constant erosion of its volcanic rock into the valley below Civita used to be nicknamed the Dying City. Nowadays as hundreds of thousands visitors    large number of them Chinese    in recent years are thronging into the natural beauty of Civita the tiny village has experienced a new life. ',China
' Only 40000 people visited Civita in 2013 but the numbers are surging in recent years said Pomi. Last year Civita was visited by 850000 tourists with Chinese accounted for 18 percent to 20 percent. And in 2018 the number of visitors is estimated to reach 1 million according to Pomi. ',China
' The influx of Chinese tourists epitomes the desire of Chinese tourists to see not only cities but also countryside of foreign countries according to tourists and guides interviewed by Xinhua. ',China
' I hope to understand the ancient civilization of Italy a little boy who came to visit here with her family said. ',China
' Antonella Decandia general manager of Dongyifang Tourism Consulting Company told Xinhua that Chinese tourists in recent years put greater emphasis on comfort and personal experience when travelling. ',China
' For example they d like to learn to cook Italian food take children to learn Italian music and art and take children to participate in football training etc. That trend partly explained why the ancient tiny village of Civita has attracted more and more Chinese visitors. ',China
' There are many Chinese tourists coming to our restaurant every day. I feel them very respectful said Diana Giacobbi a local resident in the larger Bagnoregio village who worked as waiter in a restaurant in Civita. ',China
' The booming tourism offers us job and opportunities to know different cultures and languages she added. ',China
' BOOST TO EMPLOYMENT ',China
' Local people s standard of living has been largely improved thanks to the booming tourism in Civita di Bagnoregio. ',China
' The arrival of large number of tourists have promoted greatly our economy and make the unemployment rate here at nearly zero and local residents pay zero tax to the government Pomi said proudly. ',China
' The hotel and catering industry here have also taken the opportunity to get renovated and upgraded he added. ',China
' Several neighboring towns are planning to team with Civita di Bagnoregio in extending the sightseeing route to attract more tourists too. ',China
' We need to provide more attractions such as the beautiful scenery of other ancient towns nearby which worth visiting so the tourists could stay said Pomi. ',China
' As the number of Chinese tourists grows fast the Italian tourism industry has done plenty of work to improve services. Some hotels have begun to supply Chinese translation service and Chinese breakfast. ',China
' More shopping centers have introduced mobile payments such as the Alipay for Chinese customers while some airports have opened WeChat public accounts to supply flight information conveniently for Chinese visitors. ',China
' Asked about criticism that a large number of tourists may affect the daily life of the local residents Pomi said that the benefits of booming tourism outweigh its downsides after all. ',China
' This is a common problem in areas where tourism is developing rapidly. Some people may complain that the arrival of tourists has left their homes without parking spaces. But zero taxation lower unemployment and the promotion of the town s international popularity have brought a series of benefits and some unpleasantness is always acceptable he said. ',China

' Shenzhen is to strengthen its regulations on smoking in public places making it the strictest smoking policy in history Nanfang Daily has reported. ',China
' The strenghtening is to focus on five areas of the policy. ',China
' Since the implementation of the smoking policy in Shenzhen on March 1 2014 smoking in public places has been banned carrying a total fine of 3.745 million yuan comprising a 3.325 million yuan fine for illegal smokers and 420000 yuan for public places that failed to control smoking. ',China

' As a reporter I tracked China s macroeconomic stories last year. Sometimes the news may make people depressed when words like slowdown financial risks and bad debt appear in the headlines. However at other times frequent use of words such as strong consumption technological innovation and rebalancing could cheer readers up portraying a bright outlook for the economy. ',China
' Ahead of this year s two sessions China Daily asked more than 20 foreign media outlets around the world which areas would be of interest to them. One was how China can maintain economic vitality in the current global economic environment  ',China
' I have always tried to explain this key issue in my stories. Investors and academics are also keeping a close watch on signals from policymakers and the market. ',China
' Through macroeconomic policies monetary authorities have tried to support growth by injecting funds to drive up investment and fiscal policy administrators have cut taxes to promote factory production. ',China
' I raised this same question with Zhu Min one of China s most influential economists in a recent interview. With years of experience working at the executive level of the International Monetary Fund and China s central bank Zhu showed his confidence with a gentle smile. ',China
' In China innovation is becoming the key issue now he said. And 5G will fundamentally change the picture of innovation to areas that have never been reached before. ',China
' Zhu also mentioned some other fields including artificial intelligence the internet of things and the consumption upgrade to be watched with a high degree of anticipation. ',China
' The Financial Times  chief economic commentator Martin Wolf wrote in his column that the Chinese economy is rebalancing and that consumption is at last becoming the most important driver of demand. ',China
' While the shifts are slow and the full adjustment to more reasonable levels could take until the middle of the next decade we are seeing early signs of the necessary change in the structure of the Chinese economy... he said. That would in turn be good for China and for the rest of the world. ',China
' Of course there is always a dark side to consider too with worries and fear. More discussions on the Chinese economy   and on the measures needed to maintain the world s strongest growth engine   will take place during the two week two sessions. Both pessimists and optimists will join in with their opinions. ',China

' BEIJING    An international research team has for the first time identified nine genes responsible for eyebrow colors according to a new report published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. ',China
' Eyebrow color is one of the most recognizable visual traits of the human body. It has a strong correlation with hair color but scientists believe in the existence of overlapping and unique genetic components for both traits. ',China
' Previous studies on human eyes hair and skin color have identified multiple gene variants but no findings for eyebrow color have been reported as of yet. ',China
' Eyebrow color shows a high degree of variation in Europeans. Moreover hair color and eyebrow color are not exactly the same. Many people with brown hair have black eyebrows. ',China
' Using the method of genome wide association study researchers from China the Netherlands Australia Britain and the United States analyzed samples of 6513 European individuals and graded colors into four categories  red blond brown and black. ',China
' They found that eight genes were previously known pigmentation genes and could affect both eyebrow and hair color such as gene variant MC1R responsible for both blond eyebrows and red hair. ',China
' In addition C10orf11 is the newly identified gene that only affects eyebrow colors. ',China
' With these findings researchers developed an eyebrow color prediction model and are ready to improve it by studying the different age distributions. ',China
' Liu Fan lead author of the article and researcher at the Beijing Institute of Genomics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said such a DNA based eyebrow color prediction model would improve the human phenotype research and be useful in future forensic applications. ',China
' Based on the new discoveries we can more accurately infer individual hair eyes skin eyebrow color and other phenotypic information just from a DNA sample Liu said. ',China

' The museum named Wang Xudong director of Dunhuang Academy in Gansu province since 2014 as Shan s successor. The academy manages and studies the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang also known as the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas including hundreds of temples at a Silk Road crossroads. ',China
' In 2012 Shan took the helm of one of the world s premiere museums. As China s imperial palace from 1420 to 1911 the museum welcomes millions of visitors each year   more than 17.5 million in 2018 among the most of any museum in the world. ',China
' Shan became director when the museum was beset by controversies including a crowding problem a burglary and a case of someone damaging its exhibits. ',China
' He is often credited with taking creative measures to turn things around. To control the crowds he set a cap of 80000 daily visitors and he improved the security of the museum and its exhibits. ',China
' Shan also has been known for helping the public see more of the museum and its treasures. He expanded the area accessible to the public from 30 percent in 2012 to 80 percent today. ',China
' The museum is guardian of more than 1.86 million cultural relics according to a detailed inventory finished during Shan s tenure. That accounts for 42 percent of country s total number of registered national level precious cultural relics. ',China
' But while less than 1 percent of the treasures was exhibited in 2012 that number was expanded by 5 percent last year and plans are for 8 percent to be available for viewing by the end of this year. ',China
' While many of Shan s predecessors shunned the limelight Shan did not. He gave hundreds lectures across the nation on the museum and collected more than  100 million in donations to support its development and restoration of relics he said. ',China
' He helped promote documentaries and shows featuring the museum and oversaw development of more than 11000 kinds of cultural souvenirs that had annual sales of over 1.5 billion yuan   223 million  as well as digital apps and video games. ',China
' Criticism of Shan was sparse though some grumbled that the light show at the museum for the Lantern Festival was a little on the flamboyant side. ',China
' Both the Palace Museum and Mogao Caves were listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1987 among the first in China. ',China

' The China Earthquake Administration pledged to enhance its earthquake detection capability as it rolls out an experimental project in the country s tremor plagued southwestern region. ',China
' The administration has established over 360 new monitoring stations in the China Seismic Experimental Site which spans Sichuan and Yunnan provinces since construction of the project was launched about one year ago Zheng Guoguang vice minister of emergency management and head of the administration told a news conference on Friday. ',China
' The area previously had about 1000 monitoring stations. ',China
' China is the only country that lists forecasting earthquakes as a government responsibility. ',China
' Considering our limited knowledge about earthquakes the forecasting work has to be based on observation. However the weak signals from underground are often disrupted by electromagnetic interference he said. ',China
' He said that in cooperation with the government of Shenzhen Guangdong province his administration has established a research institute to accelerate the development of new apparatuses for underground detection that could reduce interference from human activity. ',China
' We will also explore carrying out observational experiments in wells from hundred of meters to 1000 meters deep and through scientific drilling that will penetrate active earthquake faults to gain more information about underground structures he said. ',China
' Currently 13 countries have been involved in the project including Russia Egypt and Algeria and 17 domestic research teams including one from University of Science and Technology of China have started research on the site Zheng noted. ',China
' The site will offer research teams with observation equipment support for outdoor observation and data sharing services he said. ',China
' Wu Zhongliang director of the administration s Institute of Earthquake Forecasting said the experimental site will help form a united front at the national and international level to work on earthquake forecasting. ',China
' Referring to earthquake forecasting as a hard nut to crack Wu said the work cannot see marked progress just in a few days but forecasting capability will be improved as technology develops. If it s a war between humans and earthquakes it s us that will finally win he said. ',China
' Paul Tapponnier a distinguished research professor at the administration s Institute of Crustal Dynamics said he wholeheartedly welcomes the project. China boasts unique conditions to carry out the experiment as most of its earthquakes occur inside the land under the feet of the people rather than in the ocean and there are many active faults in the country. ',China
' My personal hope is that if there is any way or any future in trying to forecast earthquakes it may very well happen in China said Tapponnier also foreign associate member of the United States  National Academy of Sciences. ',China
' According to the administration the country is stricken by an average 20 earthquakes above magnitude 5 every year. There is an earthquake above magnitude 8 every decade. Since the turn of the new millennium more than 91800 people have been killed by earthquakes in the country. ',China

' Four leading ethics scholars in China are urging government authorities to intensify their supervision over scientific research to reduce the chances of unethical use of biomedical technologies involving gene editing and stem cells. ',China
' The appeal published in the journal Nature on Wednesday referenced a major ethical scandal in November when a Chinese scientist announced he had produced the world s first twin human babies whose genes were altered to make them immune to HIV. ',China
' Hundreds of Chinese scientists voiced opposition and questioned the safety and effectiveness of the procedure following the announcement by He Jiankui 35 who was an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen Guangdong province. ',China
' The university terminated He s employment contract following the incident. A team of investigators said he deliberately evaded oversight to conduct the research in pursuit of fame and profit and may face criminal charges. ',China
' In our view China is at a crossroads the four scholars said in the Nature commentary. The government must make substantial changes to protect others from the potential effects of reckless human experimentation. ',China
' The authors were Lei Ruipeng professor of bioethics at the School of the Humanities and Centre for Bioethics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan Hubei province  Zhai Xiaomei professor of bioethics and health policy at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences  Centre for Bioethics in Beijing  Zhu Wei an associate professor at Fudan University s Centre for Applied Ethics in Shanghai  and Qiu Renzong a philosophy of science and bioethics professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  Institute of Philosophy in Beijing. ',China
' We think the authorities should step up their efforts to improve the governance of ethics in scientific research in light of the loopholes exposed in He s case Zhai told China Daily. ',China
' Results of further investigations in the case should be made public including the penalties given to all involved she said. ',China
' One reason for publishing the article on Nature was to show the resolve of the government and ethics scholars in China to improve ethical compliance in the sciences Zhai said. ',China
' In the commentary the four scholars said the government should release clearer rules and regulations on the use of technologies and hand down sharper punishments to offenders including disqualifying them from scientific research. ',China
' Self regulation of scientists is unlikely to be enough given their potential conflicts of interest under market pressures. Thus top down regulation is crucial they said. ',China
' The scholars suggested that authorities such as the National Health Commission should monitor all gene editing centers and IVF clinics in China to ensure trials are in line with regulations. ',China
' A national registry dedicated to clinical trials involving cell technologies should be established to promote greater transparency they said so that before a trial begins scientists would need to pass an ethics review and provide a list of names of all participating scientists and institutions. ',China
' Universities and research institutes should strengthen education and training in bioethics and scientific and medical professionalism covering research scientists and students of science medicine and the humanities at all levels they said. ',China
' In addition more efforts should be undertaken to eliminate prejudice against people with disabilities which exists in the minds of some scholars they said. Following the gene edited baby incident government departments have vowed to improve supervision and new regulations are being made or revised. ',China
' The National Health Commission issued draft regulations in February for the clinical application of new biomedical technologies stipulating that clinical research that involves human trials including gene editing stem cells organ transplants between species and assisted reproductive technologies must secure the approval of the commission in advance. ',China
' Under the draft which is yet to be adopted violators may face punishments including fines revocation of business permits or criminal charges. ',China
' The commission this year will complete its revision of an existing regulation on ethical inspection of human related biomedical research that was adopted in 2016. ',China
' Authorities are also considering establishing a national ethics committee that supervises life science technologies and researchers to ensure compliance with ethical standards Huang Jiefu former vice minister of health told China Daily in an earlier interview. ',China
' Although some hospitals have established such committees many of them are loosely organized and incapable of ethical inspections to ensure people s lives and health in cases of highly risky clinical trials he said. ',China
' Zhai of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences said existing regulations for oversight of the life sciences come from various government departments and don t sufficiently deter violations. ',China
' Higher level legislation is needed to establish law to hold violators criminally accountable and deter any similar behavior she said. ',China

' Authorities in Hangzhou Zhejiang province have proposed regulations to protect child models after a video went viral showing a girl being kicked by her mother during a fashion photography session. ',China
' The regulations said to be the first of their kind in China prohibit adults from beating or scolding child models. ',China
' Companies are banned from hiring children under the age of 10 for advertising requiring children to model longer than a month or having them work continuously for more than a week. Any work session or event involving child models should not last for more than four hours. ',China
' The draft also stated that adults should not make child models pose inappropriately or wear clothing that are not a match for their age range. It also requires regular checks to be conducted by the authorities. ',China
' Members of the public are encouraged to report infringements on the rights and interests of minors. ',China
' Any modeling activities or adults harming the interests of children may be subject to public interest litigation said Chen Yungao a prosecutor in the people s procuratorate in Hangzhou s Binjiang district as quoted by the Hangzhou Daily on Thursday. ',China
' The procuratorate together with Hangzhou market regulators and the district s Communist Youth League Committee drafted the regulations after a video of a mother kicking her 3 year old daughter during a photo shoot drew outrage on Chinese social media in early April. ',China
' The girl Niu Niu was kicked because she was too tired to perform. ',China
' Many viewers of the online video said the mother had been abusive and was only using her daughter to make money. ',China
' The woman apologized in a statement on Sina Weibo two days after the incident explaining that the girl is deeply loved and receives the best care. She said she had no intention of hurting or abusing her. ',China
' She also told Beijing News that the family does not rely on the child to earn money and her husband has a job. ',China
' The girl had modeled for online retail stores for around six months. Modeling photos of Niu Niu have all been taken off commercial sites since the incident. ',China
' As the country s e commerce industry develops the demand for child models and children s products has increased especially in the region of Hangzhou which is home to Chinese e commerce giant Alibaba. ',China

' What is also important is to not be a  closed box  Lee says. We need to open our eyes ears and minds to sense and experience other cultures. Art alone cannot bridge cultural divides if people aren t willing to be open. ',China
' Lee recalled how he managed to pique the interest of many Chinese artists when he introduced European street art to China through the Shanghai Expo in 2010. The event he added had planted a seed in the minds of local artists spurring them to find out more about this foreign art form. ',China
' In 2015 Lee sought to foster cultural exchange by bringing together performers of Kunqu Opera a Chinese traditional opera form boasting hundreds of years of history and classical musicians from Belgium to perform in a concert titled When East Meets West during the Shanghai Arts Festival. ',China
' People with traditional theater backgrounds are usually very conservative because they spent most of their lives mastering the traditional craft. They tend to dislike anything that is too avant garde. They resist foreign ideas and are reluctant to try combining the modern with the new he says. ',China
' I remember there was a well known flute player from Kunqu Opera who was initially apprehensive about playing alongside a classical violinist from Belgium but her mind was changed after seeing the wonderful results. I thought that this was very meaningful because this breakthrough meant that she could go on to teach her Chinese peers about the beauty of cross cultural collaboration. ',China
' Troiani also weighed in on the importance of such endeavors. ',China
' As the world becomes more connected the requirement for young people to graduate with skills they can use internationally becomes even more important Troiani says. Being able to understand and respect cultural differences while sharing ideas values and traditions is a form of cultural exchange which gives true meaning to being a global citizen. ',China

' BEIJING    Chinese President Xi Jinping began his pre Chinese New Year domestic inspection tour Sunday visiting Southwest China s Yunnan province. ',China
' He headed for a village of the Wa ethnic group to learn about poverty alleviation efforts and extend his festival greetings to the villagers. ',China
' The Chinese New Year which falls on Jan 25 this year is the most important festival for Chinese people who beat all odds to return home to be with their families and friends. ',China
' Before previous Chinese New Year festivals Xi also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission would always visit the homes of ordinary people. ',China
' Many of the families Xi visited were the disadvantaged and poor who live in tough environments and in remote areas. It is these people Xi cares deeply about with the battle against poverty being his top priority. ',China
' During the visits he would sit down with them listen to their concerns and join them for festival preparations ranging from making sticky rice cakes to frying dough and pasting red paper cuttings. ',China
' In 2019 he walked into traditional courtyard homes in Beijing. ',China
' In 2018 he trekked mountains to visit ethnic minority villages in Sichuan province. ',China
' In 2017 he went to the snowy countryside in Hebei province. ',China
' In 2016 he traveled to the cradle of the Chinese revolution in Jiangxi province. ',China
' In 2015 he returned to the village of Liangjiahe in Shaanxi province where he spent seven years in his youth living and working alongside peasants. ',China
' In 2014 he braved the ice and snow to visit families living on pastures and forest farms in Inner Mongolia autonomous region. ',China
' In 2013 he visited poor villages in remote and barren mountains of Gansu province. ',China
' DIFFERENT FAMILIES SAME GOAL ',China
' Jihaoyeqiu s house was perched on a hill in mountainous Liangshan Yi autonomous prefecture one of China s last pockets of deep poverty. ',China
' In 2018 Xi visited Jihaoyeqiu s ramshackle home. He checked the family s living conditions and asked whether they had enough to eat and wear. In a later conversation one of Jihaoyeqiu s fellow ethnic Yi villagers said she used to believe that she was haunted by ghosts as she often fell sick. ',China
' Xi said in the past there were ghosts of poverty and backwardness. But as people gain more knowledge attend to personal hygiene and live higher quality lives these ghosts are being banished. ',China
' Our socialism aims to create good lives for the people Xi said. ',China
' He is determined to eradicate absolute poverty which has haunted the nation for thousands of years. In 2013 he put forward targeted poverty alleviation and a goal was later set to eliminate extreme poverty by 2020. ',China
' Over 10 million Chinese people shook off poverty every year since 2013. Jihaoyeqiu is one of them as his family moved into a 100 sq meter four bedroom home in a new relocation village out of the inhospitable area. ',China
' Fate also changed for Xu Haicheng. In 2017 Xi sat down with him in his rural home in Zhangbei county and helped sort out Xu s family budget. ',China
' Xu told Xi that his family of four earned over 43000 yuan   6269  a year growing potatoes beets and oats but had to shell out more than 35000 yuan for his wife s medical bills and his daughter s college expenses. After spending on daily necessities Xu had little money left for the extras. ',China
' Xi consoled him pledging continuous support for families like Xu s and called on cadres to help by designing more effective targeted poverty relief measures and fostering more sustainable industries. ',China
' Eliminating poverty improving livelihoods and achieving common prosperity are the goals the Party has always been committed to Xi said. ',China
' Jinggangshan was a base for the Party in its early revolutionary days. But the cradle of the Chinese revolution was also facing a tough fight against poverty when Xi visited in 2016. ',China
' Xi went to the home of Zuo Xiufa a Red Army martyr descendant learned that the family planned to earn extra income by making bamboo tubes and wished them good fortune. ',China
' Out on the streets he joined locals in making sticky rice cakes. In the home of Zhang Chengde Zhang s wife commended Xi for governing the country well so that ordinary people have a sense of fulfillment. ',China
' The people are the masters of the country Xi responded. The job of all officials myself included is to serve the people. ',China
' Observers said though Xi visited families of various backgrounds he stuck to one task  leading the people to strive for better lives. ',China
' In 2019 a campaign themed staying true to our founding mission was launched to ensure the Party remains true to its original aspiration and keeps its founding mission firmly in mind. ',China
' All the hard work struggles and sacrifices the Party has made since its founding are for the happiness of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation Xi said at a meeting to summarize the campaign earlier this month. ',China

' Berlin on the Elbe River perhaps another milestone on the way to the German capital was Berlin a week which in the Hanseatic City of Hamburg in Berlin and Berlin enlisted. The hotel Berlin was opened at the Berliner Tor and all guests staying in the future No more in the first or second floor but am Kurf rstendamm or the radio tower  The familiar images of the old Berlin were again summoned on many events and exhibitions. The traffic was impacted by the double decker buses and a real breeze blew over the City Hall square as Otto Otto of the Hamburg police Chapel coaxed the Sportpalast Waltz Berlin air  guaranteed Berlin tones at the Waterkant. 100 years white sausage but also the Bavarians had plenty to report this week. They celebrated the 100. Birthday of the white sausage a popular national but only then reached its culinary climax when she consumed according to certain rules  original sound  a mug of beer is the only basis for this Of course because a white sausage that doesn t swim is like a fish without water. The stars were cheap because the 100th birthday went hand in hand with the famous Salvator sample. Numerous celebrities loomed their Wiesn and celebrated the stout time as outstanding event of the Munich based company. Twelve years after twelve years then went two training ships of the German Navy for the first foreign trip on Atlantic course. This destination was the French fleet base Brest which was destroyed during the war to 70 . The French sailors but were this time colleagues and in the same place where was once bitterly fought the ship friendship visits switched now to ship. Small visits receive the friendship and when the rude language of the cannon is replaced with the polite conversation then progresses also the major policy to several nautical miles. The past was sealed with a warm handshake. The past along with their opposites. Paradise of children this year was a Sesame open you to the dream land of children the trade fair of the German toy industry. Europe s largest doll showed 100000 attractions. During his week of the fighting against the growing Specter of inflation Economics Minister Erhard in Nuremberg took a few carefree minutes. This game he could make exceptionally good face. The age of rocketry has conquered even the nursery. And miniature nu  ...  often is the childlike imagination the image of a perfect mechanism. The undisputed fair hits this is the remote controlled puppet. A cute dressed robot that does what you want with it but unfortunately unable to play how you want. This being is don t trust even the dog. The most unusual animal friendship of the world witnessed no fear of large animals in the circus Willi Hagenbeck where the Boxer Daisy mother of the Abyssinian lion Negus was formerly. And when it turned up in Daisy the young was a strange transformation  from the lion s paw to the Velvet paws and the King of the desert to the loving babysitter. That you first look the giant uncle in the mouth you can hardly blame the Boxer slip. But every suspicion here is in the wrong place because each place is readily conceded. Negus carefully Pack all occasions to the affirmation of his love on the tail. Finally you committed the strong friend as a soft pillow for the conscience. Sports  Berlin  the billiards tricks of the  big three  Germany s best pool players attacked three cushion Championships in Berlin at the German deep in the bag and gave their tricks at the green table for the best off the record. The 29 fache German champions Walther L tgehettmann. The D sseldorf Siegfried Spielmann. And again L tgehetmann with a pronounced push of the parade. Hamburg  For the Championship in the middleweight division his title as a German Middleweight champion was at stake as was Peter M ller in Hamburg against the Frankfurt Erich Walter in the ring. The youthful Challenger has a remarkable stamina. Eight laps he is brave to fight and only in the ninth a swing of the legs tear him. Coach MacPherson knows that the minutes are counted. The Frankfurt No more has the final spurt of the master. The experience from over 100 profile fights Walter is no more chances. After 12 rounds of spirited the points clearly for Peter M ller speak the old and new German Champion in the middleweight division. Vienna  Germany beats Austria 3 2 Federal Sepp Herberger had every reason to smile for the German national team  in the green dress  played against Austria like in those days. The first German attack is fought off Austria s goalkeeper sends his assault on the trip. Right wing Halla Touchline but Hammad itself draws the header by Koslicek. In the 24th minute Rahn roars away. A mid shot and 1 0. The counter attack of the Viennese brings a dangerous situation. Hammad loses the ball. Wevers saves and Once again it looks like brenzlich. Only with an artistic leap Defender Schmidt may clarify the situation. Now the German combination machine smoothly runs. Whirlwind Kraus increased to 2 0 and the German fans fall unfortunately from the role. In the second half technology is replaced by hardness. There is a fight on bending and breaking.  Erhardt can brake only irregular the Flash erupted Buzek. Wagner I placed the imposed penalty to 2 1. The same foul in the Austrian penalty area. Brenda lifting the ball over the wall. 3 1 a typical combination of the Viennese School of young striker Buzek crowns with a second goal for Austria.   But now the Viennese have shot all their bullets. The few scoring opportunities are thwarted by the German backs. It remains in the 3 2 for Germany. ',Germany

During an extended spring walk our cameraman with satisfaction noted that Professor Heuss feels so right. Yet at his vacation home again recovered President made the first official act. He received the new Japanese Ambassador Ryuji Takeuzhi. Eilat In the Middle East are emerging more crises. The State of Israel which wants to transform the port of Eilat at the vertex of the Gulf of Aqaba into a naval base is again facing a difficult problem provided. Saudi Arabia considered waters of the Gulf and wants to block the passage of Israeli ships at gunpoint. The Saudi Arab opposition was carried out a few days after the first American oil tanker for Israel had broken through the 7j hrige barrier. The old motive for war Israel would again conjured up a second blockade. Geneva the peaceful image of the week was the Assembly of the former war participants in Geneva. The Association which has more than 20 million members sent delegates from 35 countries. And so it happened that one side by side saw Israel and Egypt in an undisturbed neighborhood.

East Berlin the ghostly theme of civil war was on the agenda of the Soviet zonal Betriebskampfgruppen in East Berlin practice area was the Alexanderplatz square and according to order of the SED the battle group had the task to destroy a minority of counterrevolutionary enemies.

These days the magician of the sign monastery celebrated its 80. For the lonely artist birthday and a vivid Canary was the most beautiful holiday greeting. For half a century the demonic images of visionary art were born in this room. What lives in them is the terror and horror history who far rushed ahead our time to To find a terrible confirmation in the fact of the experienced present. In the black and white brilliant stroke of the pen Kubin has found the form and the formula of his art. Fascinated by the specter of his century he conjures up as man and as ban artists. Beauty is beauty is Trump recognized also the new Republicans from Ghana and sent their beauty queen on a friendship tour to London. The Englishman inherently know what deserves a Queen and so they sought warm heart to the blessings of civilization of the dark skinned beauty everywhere endeavours. How richly blessed is the tenth German Federal State with beauties which proved the excretion of the opal works for the election of Miss Saarbr cken in Saarbr cken Germany. The Saarland capital wanted to not bring discredit and sent a fine selection of avatar applicants in the fight to win the favor of the audience.

Dazzling in form Germany s biceps matadors in the Mannheimer Muse Hall were Marathon of muscle. With a much younger team she participated to the international competition of muscles against France. The most impressive performance offered the lightweight Willi Kolb. With 115 kilograms he set a new German record in the two terms. But also the French did play their forces. The third Olympics Jean Debuf won in the Mittelschwergewicht. With a total of 24175 kilograms the French result by 30 kilograms was lighter than the weight the German team   brought to the high line. Thereby our muscle Prince celebrated a powerful success. A sensation on the trotting course weather enthusiastic Italians at the big lottery prize of Agnano experienced trotting sensation in Agnano. The French record holder Gelinotte is favored. Checco PRA and Assisi To give a brief Intermezzo as a front runner. But a horse from midfield dissolves after a few meters. Irresistible it passes on his rival. The followers of the Favorites are disappointed. It is namely not Gelinotte it is the 5 outsiders Tornese which the Sulky veteran Mario Santi imposes on a murderous trot. Yet is not all days evening. The experts talk about a waste of power. Until the final Sprint will prove it. And there s even Gelinotte. On the inside Lane she takes on the track. But her attack comes too late. Tornese WINS and once again ensures the good reputation of the unpopular outsider.

Powerful Faeder prevails against two defenders and completed a 2 0. After halftime the benefits clearly Hertha s page are. The Elf from the Gesundbrunnen dangerously harassed the sanctuary of the violet. A few counterattacks of the Borussia remain the fate of Borussias without resounding success the 50th minute sealed. Dove no. 8 takes a template to a 3 0 over the line. So Hertha BSC becomes 16. Male Berlin Championship and participates in the games for the German Championship. Fairy night along the Seine for a few hours sank the bitter reality of our days in a fairytale night along the Seine when Queen Elizabeth ascended to the ceremonial barge Borde Fretigny.

A wing domestic demonstration against the Jordanian King s throne ended in front of the wall of the disciplined army and the royalists Bedouins martial law which was imposed on Jordan had the streets empty. After several Cabinet resolutions there is now the 83j hrige Ibrahim Haschim who pursued a conservative policy as new Prime Minister. The power in the State is still in the hand of the 21 year old Hussein seeking efforts to pull his country out of the magnetic field of the great powers. How Very much the domestic politics of an Arab country affects the world politics showed the temporary presence of units of the 6th fleet in Beirut. But the only foray the Mariner took you was a foray into the world famous entertainment district. Demonstration of mass Defense Minister Stoph welcomes the units of the national people s army at the may celebrations on the East Berliners Marx Engels Platz. As so often the former pleasure garden witnessed a demonstration of the masses and This time it was the biggest military parade since the existence of the zone. Under the motto.

The Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov welcomed the troops of the Moscow garrison on red square. Then the cadres of the Soviet army to a hours took to the stands of the Soviet Government formed. Completion of the imposing but also provoking spectacle was the parade of youth associations and the almost endless procession of Moscow population. NATO Conference in Bonn for three days was a center of the Western world the German capital of Bonn. The NATO Council of Ministers a body composed of the Foreign Ministers of the 14 States of the Atlantic Pact met for a Conference A lot attention. On the agenda were inter alia the near Eastern problem the East West tension and the nuclear arms. To German reunification the Schlusscommunique says that all efforts strongly to continue.

Congress of the ideals of life look forward   the followers of the Vegetarian Union have adopted is a well intentioned slogan which unfortunately all too often encounters resistance. In Freudenstadt they celebrated the plague of joy or the Congress of ideals. Together celebrated the great invocation which turns out spiritual climax of vegetarianism ethics health and profitability as the highest ideals. Whether newly can inspire the world through loosening and breathing exercises remains placed there but leave any. Main thing is happy  How eagerly the grandfathers even devoted to the new ideals is certainly amazing. Life begins at 60 and the latest currency that is still quite young at the age of 60 is also amazing. As young as Olga Tschechowa who on their 60. Birthday demonstrated in Munich Maison Josephine that one counts in the pension middle age of the old guard but not for the old iron. The recipe comes from Olga s own pharmacy  is young who drives childish games on the threshold of old age. During review of the existing ladies this has emerged clearly. And at the 60th anniversary it is also once allowed to lie the imposing Squad of young men at the foot. Long live the Grandma  Yet a new rhythm of rock   n roll is dead long live the Calypso  Freddie Brocksieper played it for us in Munich and demonstrated he was the champion dancer Francesco Riegel and his partner. Far more melodic than the frantic rock   n roll embodied the South American newcomer the traditional dance style in a social movement type. A type of movement that involuntarily reminds us all too modern dance steps is the Athletics discipline of walkers across Berlin. The music is secondary here however she puts these athletes already in the bone. The traditional Marathon of joints over 25 km across was a treasure trove for choreographers through Berlin. But maybe the winner ensures the necessary popularity of our proposal  as the successor of the Calypso of the walkers Boogie. The football report the tryst of the masses in London s Wembley Stadium was the Cup final between Manchester United and Aston Villa.  The drama of the team of Manchester begins Manchester already in the first half when their goalkeeper with Aston striker rudely collides   with only 10 men in the field before a severe handicap. The young storm combined but like clockwork but the zebras from Aston Villa are in the right fairway and pull out all stops of the routine. The first half remains goalless and in the second the daredevils are ridden by Aston as of the devil. Hard and rough they control go on their target and on top of that they show how to play good football. A wide flank by Dixon scored McParland.   And Aston on the ball is back. After a heated banter before the Manchester gate MC Parland manages to conjure up a rebound into the net. The Ehrentor for Manchester emerges from a corner that is redirected in the high arc and hits the Bullseye. The dream to break the victory series of Aston Villa is over. The 2 1 success given the coveted en Cup the zebras. For the 7th time. ',Germany

' World of the stars was a spectacle that moved the people these days the total solar eclipse. In Europe a dense cloud cover prevented the sight almost everywhere.

' The Nobel Prize  Two events moved the inhabitants of Stockholm these days  the upcoming Christmas Festival and the Nobel prizes. This young man who is hardly noticed by the streets of wintry Stockholm is on the way to the prize giving. It s the Munich Rome scientist Dr. Rudolf M ssbauer. Together with the American researcher Dr. Robert Hanson of the 32 year old splits this year s beipreis for physics.  At the traditional Nobel Festival in the concert hall the Royal family is present. King Gustav VI. Adolf awarded to Dr. Hanson and Dr. M ssbauer award. This year for the first time a Yugoslavian receives the Nobel Prize for literature s of the writer Ivo Andric. The applause of the Academy members but is especially the youngest Dr. M ssbauer. It comes to Berlin Paris  it was about the future of Berlin during the meeting between the German Chancellor and President de Gaulle at the Elysee Palace in Paris. The French President insisted on his view that the time for Berlin negotiations with the Soviets was not ripe. Berlin  The threat of the Soviet Union to deny access to the Western allies to Berlin could prevent the Americans not to put a battle group via the motorway to Berlin in March. Without incident the first units reached the control point dreilinden. You replace those battle group in Berlin which was triumphantly received on August 20. New harassment of Pankow which should hinder the shipment of textiles to East Berlin and in the zone could not stop the flow of Christmas packages. Still roll daily columns of fully loaded post cars from West Berlin to the border crossing of Prince Street and continue to East Berlin. This passage in the wall is one of the last points of contact between East and West. Stranded in the Elbe estuary the British freighter Ondo was a hurricane victim he got on one of the dreaded grinding sand banks of big bird sand. 8 salvage tug tried in vain to make the ship afloat again. The bailout was a race against time with each tide of the 5000 to freighter grub is 40 centimeters deep in quicksand. Whenever the storm dropped slightly tugging salvage tug with nearly 14000 HP on the steel hawser. But the pipelaying vessel didn t budge from the place. A desperate attempt to raise a portion of the cargo overboard or to heave the bags of cocoa beans in trawlers and barges have been in vain. Only a fraction of the cargo could be saved in this way. After 5 days the ship threatened to break apart. The salvage crews had to adjust their efforts. Back remained like a Ghost ship the wreck of the Ondo. This freighter fate seems sealed views in the space of Holland  100 years the telescopes and telescopes of the Dutch Leiden Observatory aimed starry nights on the celestial bodies in the firmament. The chronometer of the ancient astronomers but were also not differently as the watches of our time the barrel of the stars certain already the schedule. The watch that the physicist of Huygens invented indicated hours minutes and seconds 300 years ago. United States have zufriedengegeben satisfied are researchers not only with the instruments for observation of the planets in their efforts to penetrate the dimensions of time and space. They created technical tools to conquer outer space. The Americans is now taken a decisive step to manned flight into outer space. The Chimp of Enos is healthy returned to Earth after he had twice encircled the Earth. Enos was launched from the test site Cap Canaveral the mercury capsule an Atlas rocket. During the orbit this sensational footage taken by an automatic camera. The Earth the film shows is about 50 times faster than in reality. Sport of the week figure skating  the pouring rain could visitors of a Frankfurt Show running event  t hardly as ice star such as the European champion Sjoukje Dijkstra ran their figures. The Dutch popular in Germany impressed once again by their security and their powerful running style. The European champion pair Kilius B umler has been eagerly awaited. Marika and J rgen who repeatedly showed the versatility of their repertoires showed a classical dance in Frankfurt for a change. Horse riding  A whole lot of great jumping horses on the tournament socks got to SB jump of the CHI Amsterdam has been saddled. 3. Piercing  Irene Jansen and Kairouan   Holland   have the heart for the 2 meter wall but lacked power. Also Capitano d   Inzeo on one of his huge Irish stayed with until then. In the 4th playoff the wall stands on 210. Schockem hle Bacchus a metre too soon pulls the trigger. But some like it high. For example good bye under the Irishman of Hayes. This was the victory   but   the other half clinched the Brazilian Pessoa on Huipil. Pessoa and Hayes renounced an another stinging and was their horse  split victory double victory. Cyclo cross  The first international cyclo cross bicycle race of this season in Vaihingen took away from the start an exciting history. On the 1.8 kilometer route which is 12 times to pass through the participants fight a double battle  with the rain durchweichten ground and the big favorites. Already after the first round world champion Rolf Wolfshohl perceives his chances and tried to hang his Italian pursuers Gandolfo and Longo. The decision is underway in the 9th round  twice approaches Longo to Wolfshohl and twice Wolfshohl pulls away. The advantage of the German world champion grows from round to round and is at the end of the race even 90 seconds. 2000 spectators record it with applause. ',Germany

' Schrecksbach   a village in Germany. On the map looking for it long in vain   a fate that it shares with many other villages. Schrecksbach is a trademark but   in the vicinity of Fulda   for a year. Four young people took their village in the talk  Horst Klaus Roger and Arno   all from Bach of Schreck. They formed a pop band and called themselves the Petards   the firecrackers and succeeded in what was not province of countless bands  they made the breakthrough after only two years and they are represented on all German charts today. Rock blues soul beat   they mix it up and put it with a pinch of scare Creek nature   skillfully and so successful that they have decided to a professional career. Berlin no other city offers its residents the same chance once in the year of international cuisine as much detail to tongue and palate. Green week 1972 was traditionally opened by the Mayor and the State Economics Minister. The People s Republic of China was represented for the first time at the biggest agricultural show. This time nearly 1000 exhibitors from 43 countries showed a representative selection of the international agriculture and food production. The product test as an advertising and information sometimes almost a vaudeville Act. Original German farm scenes conjured up idyllic countryside in one of the 23 trade fair halls. No incidence of advertising but an ernstgemeintes offer of German Agriculture in nervous urbanites to spend their holidays in the countryside. Holiday on the farm   this motto farmers of the Federal Republic have entered long ago with success in the tourism industry. Especially large urban families have discovered the charm to make holidays in the nature. Save the family Fund and allow the children to realize their storybook dreams  four weeks to experience every day with animals. Chancellor Brandt in Paris. The Franco German friendship treaty   closed in January 1963   foresees consultations between the Governments of both countries twice a year. President Pompidou and Chancellor Brandt marked the political terrain for the advice of delegations in talks with four eyes. Economic and Finance Minister Schiller had an important task at this Conference two  because in his workspace was the main theme  enlargement of the European economic community to the economic and Monetary Union. The first Franco German consultation meeting after the accession of Great Britain Ireland Denmark and Norway showed  In the autumn a Summit Conference of the EEC 10 States on the strengthening of the community is advised. DIS previously opposing points of view in international monetary policy have been adjusted. President Pompidou pledged France s support for the Eastern policy of the Federal Government to the Federal Chancellor. In the Palais Beauharnais with interruptions seat German Ambassador in Paris since 1815 the Chancellor gave a festive dinner in honour of the President of the French Republic. Full match   this was the outcome of the consultation on government level. And President Pompidou both States are some than ever. A veteran from the early years of the age of machines celebrated his 100th birthday in Berlin  the Federal Institute for materials testing   since end of 1871 conveyors and scientific companion of industrialization in Germany. Even today the Institute in principle pursues the same goals as 100 years ago  to determine the chemical composition mechanical properties and the structure of materials. Only the test at the Federal Agency works today has spread almost unmistakably. Today for example a carpet test. An artificial pedestrian checks the wear resistance of floor coverings. The so called swing Hall. Here check materials steel capacity fatigue strength and elasticity. High alloy steels can be cut only with a plasma torch. Ionized gas flows with 25000 degrees Celsius from the cutting torch nozzle and separates also such materials its ignition temperature is higher than its melting point. Doors made of different materials are tested for their resistance to fire. Today 1000 scientists are employed in the 96 laboratories of the Institute. Experiment in the large testing Hall of the Department of civil engineering. Technicians test the tensile strength of steel reinforced concrete. The work of the Federal Agency is already indispensable for German industry and its technological progress. In L denscheid a focus of the German plastics industry futuristic plastic is glass and other modern materials. For five years the IKA the first international exhibition of plastic House views of the Interior of the future offers  houses made of plastic which should prove that living between plastic and foam has a future. The exhibition shows perfect living machines but also houses for making self in L denscheid. Bio dome   the first floating Kunststoffhaus of the world whose roof garden provide fruits and vegetables. Applies to all plastic houses  they are cheaper than conventionally built houses and have similar longevity. Its construction will take not months but days. Plastic houses are delivered in the second generation with complete interior decoration. The finished home out of the retort mobile modern and cheap  an opportunity for value conscious individualists who To want to escape the desolate standard architecture of today. Who distrusts the new ambiance may test the IKA  by per dwelling in plastic houses of his choice. The Nuremberg of D rer city   in the imagination of some weltabgeschieden and toward the past. The impression is deceptive. Germanic National Museum opened its doors to the youth. As the first Museum of the Federal Republic it an action space set up within its walls for experimental games  a declaration of war on the outdated art classes signed by authorities teachers and students. Art educators psychologists and educators go to Nuremberg in new ways  In the game in the spontaneous action should students understand art as a process and product. Industrial wastes are materials for the game. The modern art uses them as raw material  tubes and pipes made of plastics styrofoam and plastic items. Multi Visual experiments form the second stage  with the help of projectors and slide projectors film photography and television are playful actions experimental simulations. The third and final stage means  Reflection. The conversation in the Group evaluate the protocols films and recordings. In Germany the Nuremberg Center so far is unprecedented. Though still in the experimental stage his followers believe that there already is a model for modern art education. Even before the Olympics the Olympic site on the Munich upper Wiesenfeld is national championships. In the ice stadium 15 times German Champion faced feet   in bright jerseys   and the D sseldorfer EG. The Hall was sold out with 6400 spectators   because this game should decide the German Cup. After the goalless first third both teams are offensive. In the 25. Minute shoots the F ssener Meindl from the second row on the goal  1  0 F ssen defense slows the D sseldorf counter attacks to preserve the low own title chances with a victory over the high favorite from D sseldorf. The rough way of walking on ice shows nervousness on both sides. A surprise attack by foot in the 37th minute. 2 0  Changing feet. The favorite pros from D sseldorf resort to tricks to avert defeat. In the last third of the F ssener extend their lead  3 0  They can even hardly believe that they brought the designated German champions the stumbling in. F ssen players are not squeamish as the D sseldorf in the PowerPlay To try their luck but it remains in the 3 0  Despite their defeat the D sseldorf through their points lead of German Ice Hockey Champions are 1972.

You work in the pharmaceutical industry monitor food and investigate slaughter animal meat before it goes on sale. Before their later specialization the future veterinarians must complete a broad basic training. On dead animals students test their theoretical knowledge and learn about disease patterns. Theory and practice complement each other well in clinical teaching. Students make diagnoses treatment suggestions and carry out small operations. More than a thousand students come from 37 different countries. Also the medical treatment of animals belongs to the everyday life of students. Here they learn as a beef surgically to remove a talismanic object. A star marks the spot at which unite the rivers Werra and Fulda to the Weser.

' The Youth Hostels  Anniversary Year  A global movement celebrates its 111th birthday ',Germany
' Offering no more than a basic bed of straw in its early days the German Youth Hostel Association  Deutsches Jugendherbergswerk DJH  provides modern accommodation with an added value today helping to spread the ideals of youth hostelling around the globe. ',Germany
' Detmold Germany. It all started with a bold idea on a cold stormy night. The idea was to get youngsters out of the big cities and put them back in touch with nature and its wonders in a way that was far from the strict daily routines of school even for several days in a row by providing them with a safe place to spend the night. On 26th August 1909 teacher Richard Schirrmann and his class got caught in a storm during a long hike and it was only by pure chance that they managed to find makeshift shelter in an empty school building. That was when he came up with the idea and the name linked to countless personal memories today  Youth Hostels. Over the decades his bold idea has turned into a true success story. Today 111 years after its inception Deutsches Jugendherbergswerk has almost 2.5 million members making it one of Germany s biggest non profit organisations. It runs 450 hostels where the unique idea continues to come to life every day through the sense of community experienced in the houses. Tolerance open mindedness inclusion and environment protection are practiced in many different and creative ways. Despite its age of 111 years the spirit of Hostelling is as up to date as ever. Could Richard Schirrmann have imagined that his idea would span the globe when he opened the first Youth Hostel at Altena castle in summer 1914  It soon did quickly surpassing the borders of its place of birth. Today it inspires travellers from around the world  In 2020 over 4000 Youth Hostels are open to travellers in more than 90 countries. As the largest hostelling association world wide DJH has long since supported the foundation of new hostelling associations across the globe always happy to provide advice and a helping hand to friends of the hostelling idea. The non profit association also promotes cultural and social exchange among young people by hosting international youth exchanges. A lot has changed over the past 111 years in the Youth Hostel s native country  squeaky bunk beds itchy woollen blankets or curfews before sundown have long been a thing of the past. Instead DJH Youth Hostels have stepped into the future with new developments in various areas. ',Germany
' How to get there  The sustainable way ',Germany
' In the early years of hostelling the question of how to get there was hardly given a second thought as the whole idea of hostelling was based on the hiking movement. So for decades the way to get to a German Youth Hostel was to lace up your hiking boots shoulder your rucksack and go  Up to the end of the 1950s the classic way of getting to a Youth Hostel was by using your own muscle power  travellers hiked cycled or even came by boat to hostels that were located on the waterfront. Motorised hikers  were frowned upon. Over the course of the years attitudes changed not least in view of increasing motorisation and coaches became an ever more popular means of transport for school or group trips to Youth Hostels. Today guests often ask about parking facilities for their car. Many Youth Hostels don t provide parking spaces as DJH wants to motivate its guests to choose the most climate friendly option to get to their destination. For instance DJH members are entitled to reduced train fares. Coaches are of course always a great way for school classes or larger groups to get to a Youth Hostel even if parking may not be available right in front of the entrance. ',Germany
' The food we serve  Variety is better ',Germany
' Simple but good. That s how you could characterise the food served in Youth Hostels in the old days. In the beginning meals would usually even prepared together with the guests or guests were expected to lend a helping hand in the kitchen if they wanted a hot meal on their plates or in their lunch pail   not least to promote a sense of community. That s why until today guests at Youth Hostels still clear their own table after a meal or make their own beds. However no guest is expected to peel potatoes or cut onions anymore and the choice that s on the menu is a far cry from the old days too. There is something for everybody and staff is always happy to cater to special dietary needs such as allergies or intolerances or to special requests. Many Youth Hostels have introduced a veggie day support regional suppliers and producers and serve up true highlights  culinary speed dating a sushi bar a star chef at the stove family cooking courses fasting hikes nutritional or herbology courses are just a few examples. By the way  Youth Hostels still serve the traditional rose hip tea but nowadays they also offer a huge range of alternative flavours   and run bars and bistros offering unusual coffees or cocktails ',Germany
' More isn t always merrier  Why there are fewer Youth Hostels today ',Germany
' By the end of the 1920s there were over 2300 Youth Hostels across Germany. These Hostels clearly didn t compare to today s standards. Often they were no more than straw beds in makeshift shelters  located for instance in village schools that were closed for the holidays. Today the German Youth Hostel Association runs about 450 hostels. Has interest in them dwindled  Are guest numbers going down  No that s not the reason why there are fewer. Rather the decreasing number of hostels reflects a societal development. In the early days of Youth Hostels the goal was to make sure there was never more than a day s hike between two hostels. Hiking was the number one popular activity and young people joined clubs and groups to discover their country on foot. But over the years the enthusiasm for hiking wore off and many Youth Hostels were closed as they were no longer needed. What hasn t changed though is the enthusiasm for the Youth Hostels themselves. Every year about 10 million overnight stays are booked at DJH Youth Hostels and the association s number of members is also growing constantly. ',Germany
' Youth Hostel Managers  A passion not just a profession ',Germany
' One thing that hasn t changed over the past 111 years is that a Youth Hostel s wardens are its heart and soul. What has changed however is that they are now referred to as managers rather than wardens plus a few other things  in the past Youth Hostel wardens had to be a married couple they had to live at the hostel and had to be able to play at least one musical instrument. Obviously today s job requirements are much less restrictive. Youth Hostel managers come from the most varied of backgrounds  they are former teachers pilots wholesale agents or even former music TV presenters. What they all have in common is the passion for their job and the conviction with which they make sure that the idea of Youth Hostels continues to come to life every day 111 years after its creation. ',Germany
' Activities and programmes  DJH stands by its values ',Germany
' One of the aims behind Richard Schirrmann s idea apart from providing youngsters who were exploring the countryside on foot with a simple and inexpensive place to stay for the night was teaching them about the great outdoors they were venturing into and raising awareness for the environment the vegetation and wildlife around them. This educational aspect of the hostelling idea is one that the Youth Hostels continue to take just as seriously as its other values   tolerance international understanding and open mindedness   today 111 years later. Of course Germany s 450 DJH hostels have much more to offer in terms of activities than the classic environmental education schemes. Guests are spoilt for choice with over 2000 different programmes and offers centred on topics such as culture sports environment protection nutrition or music. There are Youth Hostels for instance that have their own sailing school recording studio circus tent or treetop walk. Many Youth Hostels today have specialised on a specific profile and cater for example to families sports groups choirs or international backpackers   and of course even in 2020 every DJH Youth Hostel is an ideal place for class trips children s groups or group holidays for teenagers.

In 2014 the castle will celebrate its 1000 year of the foundation by the Earls of Beichlingen. In the 14th and 15th century however the power of the Earls of Beichlingen decreased and they finally had to sell their castle to the Knight Hans von Werthern in 1519. In the 17th century the Lords of Werthern rebuilt the castle step by step and transferred it into a castle of Italian Renaissance style.

' Castles   Palaces in Germany ',Germany
' Whilst the exact number is not known experts have estimated that Germany is home to over 20.000 castles. From castles that look like they come straight out of a fairy tale to medieval fortresses with moats Germany features some of Europe s most impressive castles and palaces. Here are some of the most notable ones along with a short history of castle building in Germany. ',Germany
' A brief history of castles in Germany ',Germany
' The earliest castles to appear in Germany were simplistic defensive structures. These so called motte and bailey castles consisting of a keep on a raised portion of ground that was enclosed by a protective ditch and wooden palisade began to be built in earnest in the late 11th century as a consequence of increasingly frequent Viking raids. ',Germany
' However the wooden motte and bailey s critical vulnerability to attack by fire meant that gradually they began to be replaced with stone castles. Burnt down destroyed or else rebuilt as more durable stone fortifications none of these original wooden structures remain today. ',Germany
' With the onset of feudalism came a mania of castle building as lords and nobles built private castles  Burgen  to assert control over their territories  not only were these buildings defensive structures but also grand assertions of power and status. ',Germany
' Over time as the need to defend their land diminished rich landowners began primarily to build palaces and manor houses  Schl sser  as places of residence. These buildings were sometimes fortified with defensive structures but generally had more of an emphasis on comfort and style. ',Germany
' What s the difference between a Schloss and a Burg  ',Germany
' There are two words for castle  in German that sometimes seem to be used relatively interchangeably  Schloss  and Burg . Strictly speaking Burg  refers to a true castle    that is a defensive fortress typically built during the Middle Ages. On the other hand Schloss  is a generic term for grand buildings such as palaces stately homes or chateaus which were usually built after the Middle Ages as places of residence for the nobility. ',Germany
' To confuse the matter further in the 15th 16th and 17th centuries some castles that had lost their defensive significance were also transformed into places of residences. Therefore despite being true castles nowadays they are referred to as Schl sser  rather than Burgen . ',Germany
' Hohenzollern Castle ',Germany
' Situated atop Mount Hohenzollern in Baden W rttemberg Hohenzollern Castle offers panoramic views of the Swabian Alps. In the early 11th Century the first castle was built on this amazing site. However it was completely destroyed in 1423 after a 10 month siege. ',Germany
' The second castle was constructed from 1454 to 1461. Unfortunately only the medieval chapel of this castle remains today as most of its derelict buildings were demolished in the 18th century. Between 1846 and 1867 the third castle was constructed as a family memorial by King Frederick William IV of Prussia. With over 350.000 visitors per year it is one of Germany s most visited castles. ',Germany
' Neuschwanstein Castle ',Germany
' Located on a hill above the village of Hohenschwangau lies Neuschwanstein Castle. This 19th century Romanesque castle was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. However the king only spent 11 nights at the  largely  unfinished castle as he died before construction was completed. After his death the castle was opened to the public. ',Germany
' Today more than 13 million people visit the fairy tale castle annually. Speaking of fairy tales it is said that the castle served as the inspiration for Disneyland s Sleeping Beauty Castle. ',Germany
' Charlottenburg Palace ',Germany
' The largest palace complex in Berlin Charlottenburg Palace has been a favourite retreat of Hohenzollern rulers throughout the centuries. Constructed in the 17th and 18th century this opulent baroque and rococo palace was severely damaged during the Second World War. Fortunately the palace was largely rebuilt and refurnished. Today the palace is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country s capital. ',Germany
' Lichtenstein Castle ',Germany
' Situated in the Swabian Alps in Baden W rttemberg this privately owned castle is often referred to as the fairy tale castle of W rttemberg . Inspired by the novel Lichtenstein   1826  by William Hauff Lichtenstein Castle was designed by Carl Alexander Heideloff in Gothic Revival style. Construction began in 1840 and was completed in 1842. ',Germany
' You can visit the castle via a guided tour  however some rooms are closed to the public. Some 500 metres away from Lichtenstein Castle you can find the ruins of its medieval predecessor Burg Alt Lichtenstein. ',Germany
' Heidelberg Castle ',Germany
' Located on the north side of K ningstuhl hill in Heidelberg Baden W rttemberg Heidelberg Castle has a rich history. The first castle structure was constructed before 1225. Over the years the castle has been destroyed rebuilt and destroyed again. The ravages of war and forces of nature wreaked havoc on the once magnificent Renaissance building. ',Germany
' It was destroyed in the late 17th century by the French in the War of the Grand Alliance and in 1764 damaged by lightning strikes and resulting fires. The castle was partially restored in 1890  main building  and in 1897  Friedrich Building . However it was decided that a complete restoration would be impossible. Today the ruin attracts millions of visitors from around the globe. ',Germany
' Hohenschwangau Castle ',Germany
' Overlooking the German village of Hohenschwangau in Bavaria Hohenschwangau Castle was first mentioned in historical records dating back to the 12th century. Throughout the centuries it changed owners multiple times and various wars left the castle in ruins. ',Germany
' However in 1832 King Maximilian II father of King Ludwig II rebuilt the castle according to the original plans. It became the royal family s official summer and hunting residence. Since Ludwig s death in 1886 the neo Gothic castle has remained a favourite with royalty. And not just royalty   over 300.000 people visit the castle annually. ',Germany
' Braunfels Castle ',Germany
' With a history of more than 750 years it should come as no surprise that Braunfels Castle in Hesse has been rebuilt and extended many times going from a stronghold to a castle straight out of a fairytale. From 1260 it served as the Solms Braunfels noble family s residential castle and in 1384 became the seat of the Counts of Solms. ',Germany
' Today the castle is still inhabited by the family  however it is possible to visit and tour the castle. Be sure to check out the family museum which features the private collection of the counts and princes of Solms Braunfels. ',Germany
' Schwerin Castle ',Germany
' Surrounded by Lake Schwerin Schwerin Castle  often referred to as Schwerin Palace  is located in the German state of Mecklenburg Vorpommern. Historical records indicate that there has been a castle at this location since the year 973. Of course as is the case with many old castles many changes were made over the years. ',Germany
' Today s Schwerin Castle was built between 1847 and 1857 by Grand Duke Friedrich Franz II of Mecklenburg Schwerin. The Neo Renaissance castle was designed by Georg Adolf Demmler who took inspiration from a French castle Chateau de Chambord. After 1918 Schwerin Castle became state owned. Nowadays it serves as a seat of government. ',Germany
' Altena Castle ',Germany
' On a hill overlooking the town of Altena in North Rhine Westphalia lies Altena Castle a medieval castle dating back to the 12th century. It was built by the Counts of Berg to establish their stronghold. Over the years it has been used as a rest home for the sick a criminal court and prison an orphanage and a hospice. ',Germany
' In 1912 Richard Schirrmann set up the world s first ever youth hostel within the lower floors of the main castle building. The hostel still exists today but nowadays it is located in the former gatehouse whilst the Castle Museum is located in the main building. ',Germany
' Eltz Castle ',Germany
' Boasting stunning views of the Elzbach River and Eltz Forest Eltz Castle in Rhineland Palatinate is a sight to behold.

' We like castles and palaces in Saxony very much. These three baroque castles in Saxony should know everyone who likes locks. ',Germany
' The Dresden Zwinger impresses with its orangery. ',Germany
' Wackerbarth Castle in Radebeul offers excellent wines. ',Germany
' Castle Moritzburg offers a great location as a moated castle. ',Germany
' Castles attract us magically. On the one hand they are full of stories on the other hand they impress with their architecture. Art lovers and history lovers are right there. The three baroque castles on our journey through the castles of Saxony all originated in the time of Augustus the Strong. He either had them built for himself like the kennel and Moritzburg Castle. Or they were built by his subjects who showed themselves in his ministries. This includes Schloss Wackerbarth. Especially exciting is that each of these locks fulfills other purposes. ',Germany
' Baroque castles in Saxony and August the Strong ',Germany
' Elector Augustus the Strong lived at the time of the French Sun King. As usual in his days he undertook a journey through Europe as a young man. He also got to know the Palace of Versailles. From then on he dreamed of building a similarly magnificent castle in his native Saxony. In addition he lacked a royal crown as king. He fixed this blemish when he was crowned King of Poland. ',Germany
' In order to finance the buildings that arose during his reign a fortunate circumstance came to his aid. Elegant porcelain was known in Europe for a long time. Nobody on this continent could manufacture it alone. Until the time of August the Strong the valuable tableware was imported from China. The Chinese have been making porcelain for centuries. However they guarded the secret of its production like a state treasure. August wanted to furnish his castles splendidly. However waiting for the shipments from China made him impatient. Therefore he had research into how to produce the white gold. By chance a farmer discovered white earth on his field and with it the previously missing ingredient for porcelain production  kaolin. From then on August the Strong s zeal knew no bounds. With the profit that the products from the Mei en porcelain factory made for him he built one castle after another. ',Germany
' The Orangery in the Zwinger in Dresden ',Germany
' The Zwinger in Dresden was the first stop on our journey to the Baroque castles in Saxony. In fact the Zwinger was never completed. The plans of August the Strong went far beyond what can be seen today. Nevertheless it is one of the most beautiful baroque gardens that we have seen so far. The Orangery in the Zwinger has been wearing its name rightly since 2017 again. At the time of August the Strong 800 orange trees stood in the park. Currently there are 76. Like in earlier times they have been planted in transportable wooden containers. And as they did then they are transported to a shelter at the end of the summer. In the time of August these were the arcades that enclose the orangerie of the Zwinger. Today it is the Orangery of the baroque garden Gro sedlitz in Heidenau. ',Germany
' Oranges and bitter oranges were considered as a sign of power during baroque times. They were compared to the golden apples of the Hesperides which the Greek mythical hero Hercules stole from their garden. A ruler who owned orange trees could compare himself with Hercules. The statue of Hercules who carries the globe on his shoulders sits enthroned above the pavilion in the Orangerie of the Zwinger. ',Germany
' As in the time of August the Strong the Zwinger Orangery is open to the public. This is not without danger for the orange trees. Even the gardeners of earlier times complained about the behavior of ignorant visitors. Currently gardeners are responsible for the orange trees. These observe strictly what is good for the plants or what harms them. ',Germany
' Wackerbarth Castle in Radebeul one of the smaller Baroque castles in Saxony ',Germany
' Wackerbarth Castle is quite different. It is also one of the baroque castles in Saxony. The palace was built by Field Marshal and Cabinet Minister Imperial Count August Friedrich von Wackerbarth who was in the service of August the Strong. He had bought the vineyards. Below these he settled in his retirement home Wackerbarth s Rest. Today Wackerbarth Castle is owned by the German state of Saxony. It is run as a state winery and the castle is used for events. If you want you can marry in the rooms of the castle. But you should sign up early. The castle is in high demand for weddings. ',Germany
' This doesn t surprise us. The castle lies in a park like no other. In the middle of the vineyard above the castle the Belvedere can be found a pavilion used for events. At the top of the ridge of the vineyards is another viewing pavilion from which the view sweeps across the Elbe over the countryside. Behind the castle there is a pond whose fountain provides a fresh spray on this hot summer day. ',Germany
' Booking.com Wackerbarth Castle is a place for gourmets. In the restaurant Schloss Wackerbarth a lunch with fresh asparagus awaits us. In addition there s sparkling wine and wines from the winery. After a tour of the park and the castle we taste the wines in the champagne and wine cellar of the castle. We end our visit to this flagship winery in the wine shop of the castle which provides a great choice of local wines. ',Germany
' Castle Moritzburg Hunting lodge of Augustus the Strong and one of the Baroque Castles in Saxony ',Germany
' Castle Moritzburg shows us a different kind of Saxon castles. This castle like the Zwinger was owned by August the Strong. Only that nobody lived here all year round. Castle Moritzburg was a hunting lodge. For this reason the courtly company from Dresden moved with the entire court to Moritzburg on hunting trips. On the ground floor of the castle we see one of the kitchen trolleys in which all kitchen utensils and the valuable porcelain and silverware from Dresden were brought. ',Germany
' Moritzburg Castle is particularly impressive because of its location in the middle of a lake. As we learn the court of Augustus the Strong celebrated magnificent festivities here. Even a ship was used in this lake for the amusement of the elector s guests. But we do not see anything of that anymore. Instead some wild geese leave their quiet tracks in the lake. ',Germany
' This is what a Courtly Visit to the Hunting Lodge looked like ',Germany
' While storm clouds gather on the horizon and the wind dispels the sultry heat of the day in the late afternoon we enter the castle. There we learn how the courtly society was hosted. The court came here from Dresden at regular intervals. The journey took about two hours by coach. In the large castle kitchen food for August the Strong and his guests was prepared. Up to fifty courses were sometimes on the menu. For one meal mind you. One of the ways in which August showed his power was to have his subjects watch him at his meal. ',Germany
' The furniture we see in the castle today has been brought here from Dresden. In the times of August the Strong it was part of the baggage that was prepared for his arrival. Most of the rooms in the castle were empty. Only hunting trophies which August himself had killed hung on the walls. Among them are antlers which he received in the course of his reign as gifts from state guests. This explains the elk and reindeer antlers in the reception hall of the castle. The paintings you see in the halls today have just been hung there. ',Germany

' Hello you two great article in which I learned a lot about life in the times of August the Strong. I found it interesting that he   like so many others at the time   tried to build himself a palace in Versailles. He succeeded in a small style I would say. By the way Peter the Great has also tried that  About an hour from St. Petersburg he has built the very magnificent Petershof with a gigantic garden directly on the Baltic Sea. Anything that gets to Versailles that s it. And you as castle lovers can only really recommend a trip to St. Petersburg. What a pomp  I also liked your article so much because just two months ago I did a bike ride on the Elbe from Dresden to Magdeburg. We looked at the kennel in Dresden even though we were not so lucky with the weather as you. But at Schloss Wackerbarth and Moritzburg we unfortunately passed by. As I see here the detour would have been worth it especially if you can combine the castle visit with a good meal and a wine tasting. Definitely come on my bucket list. Regards Claudia ',Germany
' Thank you very much for the detailed comment. We are very happy about that. I can very well imagine that St. Petersburg is an interesting travel destination for us. So far however we only know  this from photos and travel reports. As far as Schloss Wackerbarth and Moritzburg are concerned a visit there is definitely worth it   whether for a break on a bike tour or a weekend trip. ',Germany
' Hello  This is a wonderful report with great pictures  I have recently seen a lot about Dresden and its beautiful surroundings on Instagram. Your article is super prepared and well researched. Thanks for reading this. LG from Carinthia Anita ',Germany
' Thank you very much for your nice comment. We are very happy if you like our article. These three baroque castles in Saxony really inspired us. Nice if we have managed to bring that over in our post. ',Germany
' Hello you two  I already looked at the kennel. I really like him. I do not know the other two goals yet whereby the visit to Moritzburg was already considered. Your report shows me that I should follow action. Seems to be really interesting. Thank you dearest greeting Susanne ',Germany
' absolutely  Moritzburg Castle is not only interesting because the film version of Aschenbr del  was shot there. The castle is beautifully situated in the middle of the lake and its history as a hunting lodge August the Strong can still be felt today. ',Germany
' I would also really like the residence in the vineyards. Great sightseeing inspiration for the summer  ',Germany
' We can highly recommend that to you. A nice place to enjoy and relax. And there are hiking opportunities right outside the front door. Perfect for you  ',Germany
' It is really beautiful  I would have loved to see it live but Air Berlin unfortunately messed up this trip that would have been next week. According to your pictures I am twice as disappointed but also determined  I am putting Dresden and its castles on the map again for 2018. Kind regards Sabine ',Germany
' the Saxon castles inspired us. Too bad your trip falls into the water. But maybe it will be something next year. I m looking forward to your report. ',Germany
' I was just in Dresden and the surrounding area and also visited two of the three castles so I can confirm how beautiful they are    The kennel is a dream and the Moritzburg is mainly reminiscent of Three hazelnuts for Cinderella and is wonderfully romantic. Since I can recommend a visit   just like you in this beautiful post   to the heart. I just remembered so beautifully. Best regards Maria ',Germany
' We can only agree with you enthusiastically. The two castles   and also Schloss Wackerbarth   are absolutely worth a visit. We have discovered more castles and palaces in the area which we will cover here soon. Maybe there is something here that interests you. ',Germany
' These are wonderful reports of beautiful castles that you have visited there. Interestingly enough Saxony is often underestimated as a tourist destination in Germany while foreign tourists have long recognized that the region around Dresden offers so much. ',Germany
' Personally I do not know Schloss Wackerbarth in Radebeul yet of course I know the kennel well and about Moritzburg I wrote an article last December  in winter this is particularly appealing. ',Germany
' We were in this region for the first time and are thrilled with what Saxony has to offer. Not only the castles are worth a trip. We also liked the scenery very much. There is certainly much more to discover. ',Germany

' Centenary of a German Export Youth Hostels Celebrate 100 Years ',Germany
' Germany is known and loved for its fast cars long motorways and large quantities of beer but its perhaps most successful export is often overlooked. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the world s first youth hostel. ',Germany
' Everyone enjoys wallowing in memories of summer vacations and holidays with friends but for many Germans a holiday is not complete without the customary stay in a youth hostel or Jugendherberge. And this week the venerable institution is celebrating its centenary with hundreds of events all across the country being held to celebrate 100 years of what became a global movement. ',Germany
' The first permanent youth hostel opened on Aug. 26 1909 in the Altena Castle in North Rhine Westphalia western Germany. It was built by a teacher named Richard Schirrmann who came up with the idea of a low cost hostel while he was sheltering from a thunderstorm one night during a school trip with his class. ',Germany

' Despite its early associations with the Hitler Youth Movement the concept of a budget oriented hostel with a homey feel has remained largely unchanged over the past century. ',Germany
' The Great Outdoors ',Germany
' An emphasis is frequently put on the environment with many hostels promoting ecological sustainability and conservation of resources. Guests are encouraged to spend their days outside pursuing activities like hiking and cycling and the first hostels were even closed during the day preventing guests from staying indoors. ',Germany
' Still today hostels    which usually have bunk beds in dormitories to encourage socializing amongst guests    intend to give city youngsters the opportunity to get away from their urban homes and enjoy the great outdoors. As travelling and so called inter railing increasingly became part of the youth culture towards the end of the 20th century the number of hostels in Germany boomed. ',Germany
' Urban Success ',Germany
' Today the hostel culture has become an international movement with over 90 youth hosteling associations spread over 80 countries comprising more than 4000 hostels. Originally limited to the hills and the countryside thousands have also sprung up in towns and cities across the world. ',Germany
' Some of Germany s most famous hostels include Berlin s  Ostel     which promises a taste of what life was like in communist East Germany    as well as Colditz Castle in Saxony a former jail for prisoners of war during the Third Reich. ',Germany
' Chains of hostels have also thrived in the past decades with some cities reporting a higher average income per room for hostels than hotels. The independent hostel industry seems to have escaped the financial crisis largely unscathed unlike the top end hotel industry that has been hurt badly by companies cutting corporate travel and many wealthy tourists not spending as much on accomodation as they have in previous years. ',Germany
' Scotland s largest hostelling association SYHA reported a 60 percent surge in booking this year after launching its first television advertising campaign. Hostelling has always been about affordable travel for all and friendly communities   values which are recession proof SYHA s head of sales and marketing Louise Nowell told the Scotsman newspaper. ',Germany
' International Jubilee ',Germany
' The German Youth Hostel Association  DJH  is another of these umbrella societies. Last weekend it hosted a huge party in Altena Castle attracting hostel lovers from all over Europe. During an official celebration that took place at the beginning of August a commemorative coin and stamp were presented by the DJH. ',Germany
' But in the same way in which the hostels themselves have surged beyond Germany s borders so will the festivities marking the anniversary. Dozens of hostels around the globe are hosting Open Door programs to promote hostels in the countries where they have not yet been established. And Australia s Youth Hostel Association  YHA  has launched a competition giving participant the chance to win 100 nights in hostels across the country. ',Germany

' DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN  1869  ',Germany
' Text and music by ',Germany
' Richard Wagner ',Germany
' A fascinating world of gods giants dwarves and wild creatures gather in Wagner s  Ring des Nibelungen . The gold on the bed of the river Rhine stolen by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who has forged it into a cursed ring gives the wearer almost unlimited power but also causes suffering and death. A myth rich in fantasy emerges a panorama of major life issues. ',Germany
' When Richard Wagner began to compose a music drama with the title  Siegfried s Tod   Siegfried s Death  at the end of the 1840s he had no idea that this work would develop into a four part  staged festival play .  Das Rheingold  was composed as the  Prelude  to this opus magnum for which Wagner wrote the libretto last but the music first. The imaginative exposition of the story was inspired by numerous sources and yet largely fictitious introducing various protagonists and their relations to one other. Wagner applied his leitmotif technique characterised by bold sounds and timbres more consistently than ever before and never used it again in his subsequent compositions. It makes the  Rheingold  score completed in 1854 a groundbreaking work in music history. As a continuous unit divided into four scenes in different settings the listener and spectator are inescapably drawn into the action including a cliffhanger that awakens curiosity for what is to come. ',Germany
' Medien ',Germany
' plot ',Germany
' SCENE 1 At the bottom of the Rhine River The three Rhine Maidens guard the golden hoard lying at its depths a treasure that would grant exorbitant powers to anyone who forges a ring with it. The Nibelung gnome Alberich approaches the Rhine Daughters and tries to convince one of them to join in a bit of lovemaking. They each pretend to fall for his charms but then withdraw from him one after another. Teased and insulted by the Rhine Maidens Alberich becomes enraged. When the light of the sunrise beams down upon it the Rhinegold begins to glow. The Rhine Maidens reveal to Alberich the special thing about this treasure  only he who renounces love can make a ring using this gold. Surely they argue that s unimaginable in Alberich s case. The Nibelung however does indeed renounce all love seizes the gold and disappears down into the depths. The Rhine Maidens pursue him but with no success. ',Germany
' SCENE 2 A plateau along the Rhine River With the dawn of the new day Valhalla Castle is revealed a fortress built for the gods. Fricka awakens her sleeping husband Wotan who is overwhelmed by the sight of Valhalla. But the goddess is concerned about the price that had been negotiated with the castle builders the giants Fasolt and Fafner. As payment for their labors they were promised Freia the goddess of youth. Pursued by the giants Freia arrives to seek protection from her brothers Donner and Froh. Fasolt demands that Wotan keep his agreement and hand over Freia. When he refuses the giants threaten to take Freia by force and thus to doom the gods to their demise for the golden apples to which Freia attends insure their eternal youth. Wotan places all his hopes in Loge to find a solution to the conflict. The eagerly awaited demigod appears but can only ease the situation to a certain extent. He reports that Alberich has stolen the Rhinegold to make a ring that would give him the greatest power and influence. Alberich Loge continues now has such a ring for he has renounced love. As a replacement for Freia the giants would accept the Nibelung s gold. But Wotan too wants to win the ring for himself while Loge wants to fulfill the Rhine Maidens wish and return the gold to the Rhine. The giants take Freia hostage  if the Rhinegold is not brought as her ransom by that evening the goddess would remain forever under their power. Without Freia s apples the gods immediately begin to age noticeably. Wotan makes the decision to descend to Nibelheim with Loge to steal the ring from Alberich. ',Germany
' SCENE 3 In the depths of Nibelheim With the help of the magic power that he gained from the ring Alberich was able to achieve absolute domination over the Nibelungs. He made his brother Mime forge a Tarnhelm for him a helmet that makes him invisible or allows him to take on another form thus protecting him from thieves. Wotan and Loge observe how Alberich has brutally enslaved the Nibelungs. They learn that he wants to use the great treasures of gold that his workers have mined to conquer the world from Nibelheim. Loge tricks Alberich to show him how the Tarnhelm works  first he transforms into a huge worm then into a toad. Alberich is then overcome by Wotan and Loge and brought to the earth s surface in chains. ',Germany
' SCENE 4 A high plateau as in Scene 2 To achieve his freedom Alberich must get the Nibelung treasure as his ransom. In addition Wotan demands the Tarnhelm and the ring. But Alberich refuses to hand them over  Wotan takes it by force. Freed of his chains Alberich curses the ring  whoever wears it is doomed to death  only when he again has it in his hands would the curse lose its force. The giants return Freia. Saddened by her loss the Nibelung treasure is to be piled up in the shape of the goddess. To cover the remaining gaps Fafner and Fasolt demand first the Tarnhelm and then the ring. Like Alberich earlier Wotan now refuses to hand over the ring. Only Erda who suddenly appears and prophesies the gods demise is able to convince him  he gives the ring to the giants. Alberich s curse is fulfilled immediately  in fighting over the treasure Fafner kills his brother Fasolt. Fafner carries off the treasure the Tarnhelm and the ring. Fricka now encourages Wotan who is sunken in worries to take residence with her and the other gods Valhalla. Donner creates a storm and Froh makes a rainbow that serves as a bridge to the castle. From the depths Wotan can hear the Rhine Daughters lamenting the lost gold. Loge who sees the gods rushing toward their demise tries to distance himself but at Wotan s insistence joins in scoffing at the Rhine Maidens. Proudly the gods march toward Valhalla. ',Germany

' The Werwolf Freikorps  Werewolf Free Corps  was one of many small active paramilitary units that fought for control of the streets of Berlin and Munich during the politically turbulent Weimar era. In 1923 this veterans group which named itself Werwolfbund Deutscher M nner und Frontkrieger  Werewolf Organization of German Men and Front Line Soldiers  was formed as apparently part of the Heydebreck Freikorps. Initially formed during the Red Revolution of November 1918 Peter von Heydebreck a German World War I veteran founded this counter revolutionary Freikorps which was apparently named after himself. This fanatical right wing predecessor of the future National Socialist brown shirts or Sturmabteilung  SA Storm Troopers  soon became involved in violent street fights and melees with communists and other left wing militias such as the League of Red Front Fighters  Red Front  and the Spartacists. During this period of time various homemade flags and standards were used by these factions of the Free Corps. Heydebreck who later become one of many SA victims of the Hitler s night time purge known as the Night of the Long Knives wrote a book of his Freikorps experiences entitled Wir Werw lfe  We Werewolves .

' The New Castle   Palace and Fortress ',Germany
' Castles were once built for economic and strategic reasons in order to secure a sphere of influence. They began to lose their military importance in the middle of the 15th century as more and more cannons were employed in war. Grand new architectures came into play for the design of castles. ',Germany
' In the post medieval period representative palaces were built in the cities and countryside as residences for the overlords of territorial states. They gradually lost their function as defensive bulwarks. ',Germany
' Fortresses took over the military role of the castle. Advances in artillery and siege technique called for new forms of defensive architecture. Lower more massive ramparts absorbed the impact of the artillery and kept the adversary at a distance. Star shaped bastions helped to avoid blind angles. At the same time it was important to prevent the invaders from setting up scaling ladders or using explosive charges from the ditch. Sometimes castles were rebuilt into fortresses. Fortress construction was expensive however and severely strained the finances of the early modern princely states. ',Germany

' For the first time in the history of the documenta the major event in Kassel was organized under the direction of a couple  Roger M. Buergel as the designated art director and Ruth Noack as curator. They served only unofficially  as a two member directorial team however as the documenta statutes do not allow for the possibility of two co directors. Together they developed a clearly defined programmatic concept under the banner of The Migration of Forms.  What that meant was that over the course of human history visual culture has had only a limited number of basic forms with which to work forms that have been used in different contexts and with different conceptual focuses throughout the history of art. Buergel Noack pointed out that contemporary does not mean that the works originated yesterday. They must be meaningful for people today. Documenta 12 is concerned with both historical lines of development in art and unexpected concurrences.  In order to bring these unexpected concurrences  to light relationships were established between works of art from different decades and cultures in which similar formal patterns have emerged a process that has led to a migration  of aesthetic forms across temporal and cultural boundaries culminating in the art of our postmodern world. This formalism was emphasized in the Neue Galerie by walls painted different colors. In turn this focus on the phenomenon of migration resulted in the selection of a high percentage of artists from Africa Asia and Eastern Europe. New to the program was the inclusion of old art from fourteenthcentury Persian miniatures to global art from recent decades. Artists already long since recognized in their own homelands such as Nasreen Mohamedi for example were not the only ones presented to a broad public in Germany for the first time. The works of several exemplary artists John McCracken Kerry James Marshall Charlotte Poseneske and Gerwald Rockenschaub also migrated through all exhibition venues. ',Germany
' Moreover the program of documenta 12 which incidentally boasted the largest share  roughly fifty percent  of women artists in the history of documenta was structured on the basis of three leitmotifs   First Is modernity our antiquity   Second What is bare life   And third What is to be done   The first leitmotif asks whether and to what extent our thinking and way of life are still pervaded by modern forms and visions   Buergel Noack . In a certain sense the second leitmotif takes up the theme of Jan Hoet s documenta 9 as it is concerned with the existential nature of the human being as a creature that is continually threatened in the postmodern era by torture terrorism and climate disasters. The third leitmotif shifted the problem of the  discursive  communication of art of aesthetic education   Buergel  into the focus of consideration. With that in mind Buergel Noack founded the international magazine project Documenta 12 magazines  in cooperation with the Vienna art publicist Georg Sch llhammer. ',Germany

' Next to the Aue pavilion temporarily erected on the Karlswiese for documenta 12  the largest single exhibition space covering 9500 square meters  the greenhouse conceived as a Crystal Palace  proved problematic not only in terms of climate control  stood Ai Weiwei s sculpture Template  2007  a tower built with centuries old doors recovered from destroyed Chinese houses  the tower collapsed during a storm and remained in place as a ruin . For Fairytale  2002  the Chinese artist had also invited 1001 fellow citizens of China to visit documenta in Kassel an invitation that caused a major stir in light of the political situation in China under its dictatorial regime and the ban on travel abroad. Ai had a wooden chair from the Qing dynasty brought to Kassel for each of the 1001 invited guests. The chairs were exhibited at the Museum Fridericianum the Aue pavilion and the Neue Galerie and used as islands of calm  for discussion within the context of the educational program. Ai s action placed the issue of migration  in a concrete political context while engaging history the present and timeless design in multifaceted dialogue at the same time. ',Germany
' Sanja Ivekovic planted his Mohnfeld  Field of Poppies 2007  in front of the Fridericianum. When the flowers burst into bloom the field was transformed into a Red Square  which in its ostensible beauty evoked wide ranging associations with the color red from the communist flag to the bloodshed in Afghanistan in connection with the cultivation of poppies for the production of heroin. Peter Friedl s The Zoo Story  2007  in documenta Halle was another of the more popular works shown in the exhibition. The stuffed threeand a half meter tall giraffe came from a zoo in the West Bank. It had panicked fallen and died of its injuries during an Israeli military operation. Friedl purchased the amateurish taxidermic specimen fashioned by the veterinarian at the zoo and had it shipped to Kassel where it was placed among garden carpets from Iran and stuffed animal sculptures by Cosima von Bonin. As a  political  work that is comprehensible only to those familiar with its history the zoo story  interrupts the migration of media images. ',Germany

In advance of the event an effort was made to establish especially close ties with Kassel through the documenta Advisory Council. Composed of forty interested citizens of Kassel who were involved in various aspects of concept development and communication the council played a particularly important role as an integral part of the curatorial composition.

' From October to December 2010 the artist Emma Stibbon lived and worked in Rome as a Derek Hill Foundation scholar at the renowned British School at Rome. Here she could immerse herself in the city s historically charged architecture and internalize the diverse symbolic codes of different historic buildings. Stibbon is primarily interested in what she calls the fragility of the monumental or the supposedly permanent. This idea of utopian architecture s fragility is underscored by the delicate character of her medium   masterful architectural drawings and cityscapes with white chalk or ink on paper or chalk on black primed wood fiberboard. In her earlier Berlin series the viewer is confronted with an artistic investigation of how one government can appropriate the architecture of earlier governments in order to legitimate its own system. Her images are sourced from reality but the play of perspective and proportions in them makes them less photorealistic than dramatic or even heroic. They are images of a  failed  utopia or perhaps even of an anti  or dystopia. The architecture is always monumental whereas the individual is very small   seemingly insignificant and overwhelmed by the physical and metaphorical scale of the buildings as well as the ideologies reflected in them. Emma Stibbon lives and works in Bristol  GB . ',Germany

' Dachau Palace garden fa ade ',Germany
' Dachau is located on a hill above the river Amper once the site of a castle which in the late 12th century passed from the Counts of Dachau to the ruling Wittelsbach family. ',Germany
' In the 16th century it became the favourite country residence of the Munich court. It was easy to get to from Munich and attractive because of its hilltop location with the view over the countryside as far as the Alps. From 1546 on during the time of Wilhelm IV  reigned 1508 1550  and Albrecht V  reigned 1550 1579  the building was transformed into a massive four winged complex. ',Germany
' Dachau Palace Banqueting Hall ',Germany
' The Banqueting Hall tract that can still be seen today was inserted between the existing wings. The outstanding feature of the hall is the coffered ceiling created by the Munich artist Hans Wisreutter in 1564 to 1566. The wooden Renaissance ceiling is one of the most important of its kind in southern Germany. ',Germany
' At the same time Duke Albrecht ordered a series of tapestries featuring the deeds of Hercules from Michel de Bos in Antwerp to decorate the walls. ',Germany
' The first major change to the Festival Hall took place in around 1610 when the tapestries were transferred to the Munich Residence. They were replaced by a gallery containing numerous portraits of members of the Bavarian ruling house and their relations. ',Germany
' Linden pergola ',Germany
' From 1806 to 1809 three quarters of the palace was pulled down. Only the hall tract remained which had been redesigned in the baroque style and was now used for storage purposes. The wooden hall ceiling was only preserved through being transferred in 1868 to the newly founded Bavarian National Museum. After the end of the Second World War it was decided that the ceiling should be returned  but it was not until March 1979 that the reinstalled wooden ceiling was finally presented to the public.

In showing the daughter of a single mother in the country who gets caught in the clutches of a Christian sect he thematized the abysms of religious fanaticism. The generations comedy Nach f nf im Urwald  It s A Jungle Out There 1995  was also supposed to air on TV but due to the film s success at Hofer Filmtage the film entered the movie screen where it became a success with movie goers and critics alike. In the film Franka Potente who lived with Schmid until 1998 made her debut in a leading role. Since then Schmid is considered to be great promoter of young acting talent. He also discovered August Diehl and Tom Schilling. ',Germany
' With his next film 23  1999  Schmid pushed the envelope even further  The film tells the true story of a young hacker who loses himself in conspiracy theories and finally dies under mysterious circumstances. 23 proved Schmid s aplomb to transform even such a topic into an authentic and accurate film that dispenses with speculative sensationalism. Schmid won the Hypo Regie F rderpreis at the 1998 Munich film festival while leading actor August Diehl received several Best actor awards. Schmid wrote the screenplay for 23 together with Michael Gutmann and later worked as writer and cinematographer for Gutmann s films Nur f r eine Nacht  1997  und Familienreise  2004 . With Crazy  2000  he adapted the autobiographical novel of the young writer Benjamin Lebert that depicts the life of a hemiplegic boy at a boarding school. With this film Schmid continued his sensitive observations of rites of passage. His melancholic episode film Lichter  Distant Lights 2003  that tells the story of several people living at the German Polish border officially ran in the competition of the 2003 Berlinale. ',Germany
' Requiem  2006  a film that again takes up the topic of excessive religiousness also ran in the Berlinale competition. Like 23 the film is based on an authentic case of a person that slowly loses its sense of reality  a young woman from a Swabian village that was forced to go through an exorcism. Once more Schmid s film attracted attention for a multiple award winning acting performance by Sandra H ller a rather unglamorous theatre actress with little movie experience. ',Germany
' Ever since 23 Hans Christian Schmid ranks among the most promising young directors of German cinema and meanwhile counts as one of its masters. At the 2009 Berlinale Schmid presents two new projects  the documentary film Die wundersame Welt der Waschkraft  The Wondrous World of Laundry  and the political drama Sturm  Storm  that moves Schmid topically and also with its cast to international territory. The film tells the story of a female attorney s fight for justice and fairness in the face of war crimes in Bosnia. ',Germany
' Schmid s follow up feature again was selected for the Berlin IFF competition. The family drama Was bleibt  Home for the Weekend  shows two grown up sons visiting their parents in the countryside. Yet family life is not as harmonious as it seems to be in the first place. ',Germany
' Brief HISTORY OF HOHENZOLLERN PALACE ',Germany
' The original fortress at Sigmaringen was first mentioned in 1077 in the chronicles of the Petershausen monastery. The oldest parts of the original castle and fortress are hidden beneath the alterations and rebuilding that took place between the 17th and 19th century. The preserved remains of the original construction date back to around 1200 during the time of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. These include the castle gate the main building and the keep. Key elements of the original structure were gradually integrated into subsequent buildings over the ages. The modern castle s foundations to a large extent follow the outline of the surrounding wall of the original fortress. ',Germany
' Architectural artifacts give us a good idea of what the fortified castle was like in the 12th century. Designed with defense in mind the original fortress featured tented and mono pitched roofs several towers and gates round window openings and friezes that made the castle at Sigmaringen something of an architectural highlight in the Upper Danube Valley even back then. The 13th and 14th centuries appear to have left no palpable trace. It was not until the 15th century that the castle entered its next construction phase under the instruction of the then Count of Werdenberg who was known for his love of building. The Count expanded the castle outwards on the north eastern side. The only part that remains from this period however is the lintel above the entrance to the Swedish Tower engraved with the year 1498. A couple of years later the castle was expanded westwards. Some years after this the building entered its third construction period under Karl II Count of Hohenzollern Sigmaringen  1576   1606 . In the years from 1627 to 1630 the castle underwent another substantial transformation under the guidance of architect and master builder Hans Alberthal renowned for his Renaissance works around Dillingen. These expansions played a major role in converting the former fortress and castle into a magnificent palace. Around 1650 Baroque architect Michael Beer combined under one roof the two separate buildings that had been constructed during Werdenberg s ownership. The palace then remained largely untouched with only small scale expansions and remodeling work during the 18th century. The Gallery of Ancestors was constructed as early as 1736 prior to a renovation in 1879. From 1860 to 1880 royal architect and first curator to the province of Hohenzollern Josef Laur introduced a Gothic Revival style  sometimes referred to as neo Gothic . The castle then underwent a radical redesign after the great fire of 1893 which substantially damaged upper part of the castle. This project was undertaken primarily by Munich based architect Emanuel von Siedl with assistance from fellow architect and state building official Johannes de Pay. The result was the beautiful castle you see today with architectural elements grounded in historicism and eclecticism. The Portuguese Gallery completed in 1902 marked the end of these renovations. It closes off the castle s inner courtyard where it borders the town of Sigmaringen. ',Germany

' If you travel to India and to Central Africa you ll hear Trovatore. Nine years after the triumphant first performance Verdi s opera had achieved the worldwide popularity that moved the composer to make this comment. The fabric of the opera could hardly be more gloomy  a gypsy who wishes to avenge the death of her mother at the stake a count who wishes to use the execution of this gypsy to strike at his rival  a horrifying truth that is revealed at the moment of death. All the ingredients of Verdi s dramatic abundance appear here  mysterious sound worlds harsh contrasts vocal brilliance opulent tableaux. The cohesive narrative style gives way to the variation of suggestive musical images with which Verdi served the most important part of the drama  revenge. ',Germany
' Past History Count di Luna meanwhile deceased had two sons. One day a gypsy was discovered standing beside the cradle of the younger son. When the child subsequently became ill the woman was condemned to death at the stake for being a witch. The gypsy s daughter Azucena thereupon abducted Luna s younger son in order to burn him to death in the same place and thus take revenge for her mother s death. However she mistook her own son for the boy she had abducted. In his place she raised Luna s younger son as her own child and called him Manrico. Civil war has broken out in Spain in connection with the crown of Aragon. Luna s elder son is now the Count di Luna and is fighting on the side of the king. Manrico has joined the rebels. ',Germany
' Part One  The Duel Ferrando a captain in Luna s army tells the men in his service the story of the burning of the old gypsy and her daughter s act of revenge. He is convinced that the old woman s spirit is still haunting the earth. Leonora is awaiting the arrival of her favourite suitor the troubadour Manrico. She tells Ines how she met him at a tournament. Count di Luna who is also in love with Leonora declares his love. When Manrico s voice is heard and Leonora hurries to meet him she finds Luna whom she has mistaken for Manrico in the darkness. Manrico and Luna realize that they are not only rivals for Leonora s affection but also political opponents. They challenge each other to a duel. Part Two  The Gypsy Manrico has defeated Luna in the duel but was held back from killing him by an inner voice. In the ensuing struggle with Luna s men he has been wounded. Azucena tells him the story of how her mother was burnt at the stake and her own act of revenge in which she burnt her own child instead of Luna s son. She reacts with excuses to Manrico s doubts and questions as to whether he is really her son. A messenger announces that Leonora believing Manrico to be dead has decided to enter a nunnery. Manrico decides to prevent this from happening. Leonora mourns the death of Manrico. Luna has also heard about his beloved s plans to become a nun and intends to abduct her.

Manrico and Leonora are preparing their wedding when Ruiz a soldier in his service informs them that Azucena has been taken prisoner.

' Prunn Castle and the Nibelungenlied ',Germany
' Like an idealized version of a knights  castle Prunn Castle is perched on an almost vertical Jurassic outcrop high above the Altm hl river valley south west of Regensburg. Its impressive appearance from a distance is matched by the views from the castle of the surrounding Altm hltal countryside. ',Germany
' Lords of Prunn were first mentioned in 1037 and they will have certainly chosen the site because of its favourable position on several transportation routes. The castle itself dates from around 1200 a time when many castles were being built. The Danube region centring around Kelheim became very important in this period under the Bavarian duke Ludwig I. One of the oldest parts of the castle is the 31 metre keep. ',Germany
' In 1288 Duke Ludwig of Bavaria acquired the castle from the lords of Prunn Laaber. In the first half of the 14th century the duke then invested the Fraunberg vom Haag family with the castle. Their coat of arms the horse on a red background is still visible from afar on the castle wall. ',Germany
' The large Gothic hall on the ground floor of the medieval palas tract also has a noble and imposing appearance. The ambitions and pretensions of the Fraunbergs are equally visible in other features of the castle such as the finely profiled Gothic portals and fragments of late Gothic murals with depictions of unidentifiable castles. ',Germany
' In the late Middle Ages Prunn probably also had a widespread cultural influence. After the death of the last Fraunberg count in 1566 Wigul us Hund historian and privy councillor of Duke Albrecht V discovered in the castle the so called Prunner Codex the fourth oldest complete manuscript of the most famous middle high German heroic epic the Nibelungenlied. ',Germany
' The manuscript was transferred in 1575 to the ducal library in Munich and is today in the Bavarian State Library  Cgm 31 . ',Germany
' However who was this person who found the manuscript in Prunn is it in any way connected with the lords of Prunn and what was the cultural context in which the Nibelungenlied was related and written  ',Germany
' Visitors touring the permanent exhibition Prunn Castle and the Nibelungenlied will find the answers to these exciting questions in a varied sequence of rooms which link various motifs of the Nibelungenlied with the history of the building and the everyday world of its inhabitants. ',Germany

' III. THE REEF BUILDINGS  Which building for which plot  ',Germany
' The formation of reefs has many similarities with a real estate business. A house building approach might illustrate why Jurassic reefs grew only at certain sites and why many reefs were quite different from each other. Not every plot of ground is suited for the construction of a reef building. The characteristics of the building site demand the strict adherence to building regulations and thus only allow the construction of certain types of reef buildings adapted to these properties. Very impressive and large scale reef buildings can only be built up at very special sites and demand an enormous effort as well as the cooperation of many specialists. Every house owner knows that the construction of his house was very dependent on the availability of a suitable plot. ',Germany
' We present here some typical Jurassic building sites and their reef buildings. You will see that in comparison with modern reefs Jurassic reefs were more widespread but also more different from each other. This means that during the Jurassic Period more plots suitable for reef building were available than today. However these plots were of fairly different quality. ',Germany
' A rarity  we found excerpts of the 150 million years old  Northern Tethys Real Estate Advertiser . Let s present some of these offers. The original expos s are however not preserved any more. This is why we compare these offers with modern real estate objects and then will show what are the actual relics of those Jurassic reef buildings. ',Germany

Kids  pool leisure facilities biotope diversified and eventful nightlife repair installations naturally biological dynamic method of construction with solar energy and energy regeneration. Of course only an international syndicate under the cooperation of many specialists could construct such an outstanding resort. And it took time  However if you chose the right site and invested enough the whole business will run almost by itself after some time. ',Germany
' During the Jurassic highly diverse reefs  which are reefs composed of many different coral species  grew in such favorable sites. What is still preserved today from such reefs looks like this  Fig.27   ',Germany
' Fig. 27 shows a Jurassic reef which is composed of many different coral species  and hence exhibits a high species richness or diversity . Coral colonies overgrow each other. Their outlines are highlighted with a pencil. Each number stands for a different species. ',Germany
' Offer 2  For beginners  ',Germany
' You do not have the necessary capital for such a gigantic building object  You anyway prefer to do it by yourself  Nevertheless you would like to have a nice plot directly at the beach  Well then take this offer  Fig. 28 . The ground is somewhat unstable sand shifts and storms endanger this site. So if you do not have the necessary capital for constructing a deep foundation and for high quality building material you can still compensate this by switching over to a simple easy to repair one story construction using cheap building material  Fig. 29 . And who knows if you have some luck with the storms and if you are a good home mechanics you might even be able to later enlarge and transform your fish and chips huts into a beach resort. ',Germany
' During the Jurassic coral meadows and thickets composed of only one of very few species grew under such conditions. Mostly growth was short termed because storms or sudden deposition of mud and sand caused the death of these coral meadows. What s still left today from such coral meadows looks like this  Fig.30   ',Germany
' Fig. 30 shows a Jurassic coral meadow which was several times affected by storm events. Therefore most corals are fragmented. Only one bushy colony was preserved in life position. ',Germany
' Offer 3  Idyllic countryside ',Germany
' Why to always struggle for these beach sites which either are awfully expensive or come along with problematic characteristics  How about a quiet protected plot far away from the shoreline  Fig. 31   Naturally it is more difficult here to make a decent living but if you are not too pretentious you might want to open a small restaurant hoping that some visitors might find you  Fig. 32 . The lovely northern part of the Jurassic Tethys Sea  see Chap. VII  was particularly promising in this aspect. ',Germany
' During the Jurassic Period siliceous sponges dwelled in such sites far away from the beachline in somewhat deeper waters than the corals did. They formed sponge meadows in settings where relatively few other organisms lived mostly because there was often not enough food for them. Siliceous sponges were masters in living under very different often fluctuating nutrient conditions. What is still left today from these deeper water reef meadows looks like this  Fig.33   ',Germany
' Fig. 33 shows a siliceous sponge meadow with plate shaped sponges growing close to each other  the inclined position is due to later displacement of the rocks  ',Germany
' Possibly the small restaurant becomes well known later on. If then the business runs all right even more guests will come and you might be able to enlarge your place to a multistory building  Fig.34     ',Germany
' Fig. 34 shows a large siliceous sponge reef. Contrasting the sponge meadows from above it developed a pronounced topography. This improved the nutrition situation because current will have to speed up and more food particles will pass by. ',Germany

' King Ludwig II ',Germany
' The Great Myth ',Germany
' The people living in the region around F ssen at the bavarian alps certainly have a special relation with their king. ',Germany
' Even though they have long been influenced by a republican system of government even though most of them carry out the duty of upright citizens by taking part in democratic elections their loyalty and love for this king is perhaps unique throughout the world. Deep down in their hearts many of them have remained monarchists but this allegiance to the monarch is focused on a special person. And that is the king who grew up in their F ssen countryside who spent most of the years of his life here and who built the most regal of his castles here  Neuschwanstein. He is and will always remain their king. He has long been immortal. ',Germany
' A brief biography ',Germany
' Ludwig was born in Nymphenburg Palace in Munich on August 25 1845. The Crown Prince by no means enjoyed a carefree childhood. He and his brother Otto two years younger were supposed to become accustomed to the burden of royal duties at an early age. They were not allowed to associate with other children and any contact with their parents was reduced to a minimum. The princes  teachers were convinced that keeping their parents at a distance would promote their independence. The royal brothers spent much of their childhood away from the capital of Munich at Hohenschwangau Castle. Separated from their parents brought up by down to earth civil servants who kept to the rules and who were mainly intent on making the Crown Princes familiar with the realities of the world Ludwig lived here however in an environment remote from the great affairs of state. ',Germany
' A fantastic natural landscape and a castle like palace filled with romantic murals depicting German fairy tales sagas and the omnipresent swan images were a formative influence on Ludwig who was of an imaginative and sentimental disposition. Secretly the youthful prince began to occupy himself at night with what interested him most  theater opera librettos and literature. On February 1861 the 15 year old prince was deeply moved by his first performance of an opera. Wagner s Lohengrin was to become for him a key experience. From now on he became one of Richard Wagner s most ardent admirers and his greatest patron. ',Germany
' Still very young   18 years old   the crown prince ascended the Bavarian throne on March 10 1864 after his father King Maximilian II had died unexpectedly only 53 years old. He could be sure of the support of his subjects  Ludwig young and attractive was regarded as the most handsome king and the most popular one with the women of the day. ',Germany
' A very close and personal relationship grew up between the King and his cousin Empress Elisabeth of Austria called Sissi. They had much in common and were kindred spirits  Ludwig and Sissi liked to behave unconventionally loved solitude hated the constraints of the court were both keen on education and very well read especially as far as classical literature was concerned. Both were opposed to war and violence had a very self assured attitude towards the church and sought sincere friendship with those in whom they could find disinterested support. Neither of them was spared disappointments. ',Germany
' In the years that followed the King often described by his ministers as being out of touch with reality withdrew more and more into the fantastic dream worlds of his palaces in the wild solitude of the mountains. In only two decades on the throne new and ever bolder plans emerged. Some  for example Falkenstein Palace   never materialized. Others were turned into reality and are admired to this day by visitors from all over the world  the rococo Linderhof Palace built in the French style Herrenchiemsee Palace inspired by Versailles and as a climax the famous fairy tale castle Neuschwanstein modeled on the medieval Wartburg. ',Germany
' Loved by his people but hated by his ministers Ludwig II was declared insane in 1886 and deposed. Neuschwanstein would also be his last place of residence before he was taken to Berg Palace on the banks of Lake Starnberg. On June 19 1886 he mysteriously died in the lake. To this day the circumstances surrounding his death give rise to diverse speculations. Was it an accident while Ludwig was trying to escape was it suicide or even murder by his political opponents  The records of the secret house archives that could perhaps shed light on the mystery are still closed. Ludwig II experienced Neuschwanstein as a building site enclosed in scaffolding. He never saw it as it presents itself to the eye of the present day visitor. The construction work was not completed until after his death. ',Germany

' This two day tour begins in Munich and will take you from the Starnberg Lake and then on to Hohenschwangau where you will see Neuschwanstein Castle probably the most famous of the royal castles of Bavaria. You will then approach the impressive fairytale castle on foot along the path from the bottom of the castle hill. Neuschwanstein was planned by Ludwig II as an accessible stage setting and private residence. The castle merely provided space for the king and his servants not for the royal household. His passion for the world of legend and the music of Richard Wagner are the reasons why Neuschwanstein was constructed and almost all the rooms include backdrops depicting Lohengrin and Tannh user. You will then travel on to Linderhof Palace. This comparatively small Rococo jewel is the only one of the buildings which Fairytale King Ludwig II completed and inhabited. Your journey for the day will take you past Kochel am See and Benediktbeuern. Heading further east you will then arrive at Bad T lz where you will continue your journey past the Tegernsee and Schliersee. In the early evening you will arrive at Lake Spitzingsee  1085 m elev.  and stay at the Alpenhotel am Spitzingsee     where you can relax in the Altira Spa. Your dinner will be served in a manner perfectly in tune with your trip in the hotel s own K nig Ludwig Stube . ',Germany
' Day 2 Herrenchiemsee  The Bavarian Versailles ',Germany
' The next morning you will head out to Chiemsee after breakfast. From Prien you will take a boat to Herreninsel where you can see Herrenchiemsee Palace the Augustiner Chorherrenstift and the King Ludwig II Museum. Herrenchiemsee Palace was modelled on the Palace of Versailles in France and aimed to reflect the ostentatious pomp and splendour of the rule of its great idol French Roi Soleil  Louis XIV. Herrenchiemsee was the king s last great building project and remained largely incomplete as no further construction work took place after Ludwig s death in 1886 after eight years of construction. Although unfinished Herrenchiemsee is one of the finest palaces in Germany and home to the King Ludwig II Museum. When visiting the construction site for the new palace Ludwig used to spend the night in the Chorherrenstift the old palace. Today you can see the private chambers of the king and the impressive Kaisersaal here. You will then travel back to Prien by boat and finally head back to Munich across the Southern Bavarian countryside. ',Germany

' Do you remember my end of the year review 2019  Back then I predicted 2020 is going to be my year. Well by now I only can sarcastically laugh at this statement and say  haha. To be honest 2020 also had some lovely moments and wasn t only bad. I went on a wonderful trip to Paris at the beginning of the year and was able to be part in a TV production  I wrote more about it here  for example. I also learned to really appreciate the small things in life. Nevertheless all in all 2020 was quite an emotionally hard year   and this doesn t even only have to do with Corona. So I am more than ready for new beginnings and a hopefully a more light hearted year 2021. ',Germany

' Linderhof Palace ',Germany
' Situated in the midst of the Bavarian Alpine foothills Schloss Linderhof  Linderhof Palace  attracts visitors to the imperial villa with its spacious landscaped garden and impressive terraces. ',Germany
' A visit to Versailles moved Ludwig II to create a comparably splendid layout. A total of seven projects were proposed by architect Dollmann in 1868 and 1869 for the new Versailles in Linderhof  however none of them were implemented. In 1870 Herrenchiemsee Island was selected as the final location. ',Germany
' In the Linderhof Ludwig II instead built an imperial villa that remains a unique example of imperial castles. Despite poor transport routes and inaccessible grounds the construction was concluded in 1878 and the interior finished in the style of the Second Rococo. The Schlosspark was built between 1870 and 1880 according to designs by Effner and was decorated by Ludwig II with additional buildings. The most well known castle built by Ludwig II is the Palace Neuschwanstein. ',Germany

It is not uncommon that roommates in the 2  or 3 bed rooms form friendships that literally span accross continents. The Children s German course entails 28 hours of lessons each week in which the participants learn German at different levels with language games loosening up the lessons. Grammar and vocabulary are essential for students and therefore can t be avoided. We also practice speaking understanding writing and reading in German. Between two teaching blocks there are breaks with refreshments and drinks lunch is taken together at noon. As with breakfast and dinner we always offer a vegetarian option. On three to four days there will also be afternoon classes but on the weekends and after classes our students can devote their free time completely to their entertainment. We offer a comprehensive sports cultural and recreational program to ensure that our students never get bored. To put their new German language skills into practice we make field trips to the surrounding area to a farm an open air museum or to the farmers market in Schw bisch Hall. ',Germany

' More than two thirds of Germans in favour of speed limit on Autobahn ',Germany
' Germany s Green Party caused something of a storm this week when it announced that if elected its first act in government would be to introduce a 130 kilometre an hour speed limit on the German Autobahn. Many parties are firmly against the idea   but a majority of people in Germany are actually in favour. ',Germany
' German Greens would introduce a general speed limit ',Germany
' On Tuesday Green party co leader Robert Habeck was asked by news portal The Pioneer  whether his party would introduce a general speed limit if elected to government. He replied that a 130km h speed limit would probably be the first measure of a new government if the Greens are involved.  ',Germany
' And just like that one of Germany s most controversial questions was brought back up for debate  should there be a general speed limit on the country s network of roads that are famed worldwide for having sections with no speed restrictions  ',Germany
' The debate over this topic has already been raging for years   a proposal for an Autobahn speed limit was rejected last October   but now seems more urgent because if the latest polls are anything to go by the Greens now actually have a realistic shot at making their way into a governing coalition. ',Germany
' They have been arguing for some time now that a speed limit could save millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide per year as well as improving safety for drivers on German roads. ',Germany
' Majority of Germans in favour of speed limit ',Germany
' And according to a new study their message might just chime a chord with voters. A representative survey conducted by the opinion research institute Civey on behalf of t online.de found that more than two thirds of those surveyed would generally welcome a speed limit while one third were against it. The survey used a representative sample of 5.061 people. ',Germany
' 416 percent of respondents supported the Greens  initiative to impose a speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour. 89 percent were in favour of an alternative speed limit of 120 kilometres per hour as proposed by the Left party and a further 158 percent want a speed limit   but one higher than 130 kilometres per hour. ',Germany
' Just over two percent of respondents want the speed limit brought to 110 kilometres per hour or lower while 31 percent were totally against the idea. ',Germany
' Clear party divisions on the issue ',Germany
' When the survey respondents were divided according to their political affiliations two clear camps crystallised. The majority of the supporters of the CDU   CSU Union  61 percent  SPD  82 percent  the Left  84 percent  and the Greens  90 percent  were in favour of a speed limit. On the other hand the majority of FDP  59 percent  and AfD  63 percent  supporters were against it. ',Germany
' However there was no major division of opinion between city and country dwellers. At around 73 percent approval of the speed limit was greatest among people who live in densely populated commute regions. After that residents of Germany s big cities were the next biggest supporters with 70 percent approval. Around 63 percent of those who live in the countryside also supported the introduction of a speed limit. ',Germany

' Capital of the southern federal state Bavaria Munich is the third largest city in Germany after Berlin and Hamburg and one of the country s richest. As a rule M ncheners tend to hold steadfastly onto their heritage and exhibit it with pride so that much of what we think of as typically German  beer halls Lederhosen oompah bands  actually hails from Bavaria. ',Germany
' Unlike most German cities that were heavily bombed during the Second World War reconstruction in Munich primarily focused on restoring the city s traditional landscape and historic architecture. At the same time however the city also embraces modernity and innovation. Alongside classical architecture and beer steins sit high tech cars modern art and one of the largest expat populations in Germany. ',Germany
' A short history of Munich ',Germany
' The city s name derives from the Old High German term Munichen  meaning by the monks . This is a reference to the Benedictine monastery that stood on the site which would later become Munich s Altstadt. Sometime in the 12th century a toll bridge was established over the Isar River to profit from the passing stream of salt traders. ',Germany
' Capital of Bavaria ',Germany
' In 1506 Munich became the capital of a newly reunited Bavaria and as a devout Catholic city the centre of the Counter Reformation as well. During this time it flourished as a major European centre of arts architecture culture and science.

' Nymphenburg Palace ',Germany
' History ',Germany
' Nymphenburg Palace owes its foundation as a summer residence to the birth of the long awaited heir to the throne Max Emanuel who was born in 1662 to the Bavarian Elector Ferdinand Maria and his wife Henriette Adelaide of Savoy after some ten years of marriage. ',Germany
' Elector Ferdinand Maria and Henriette Adelaide of Savoy Sebastiano Bombelli 1666 ',Germany
' A site on the edge of the court lands to the west of the city and the Residenz was chosen for the new building   a location which at that time was still some way out of Munich surrounded by open countryside. In 1664 construction began to the plans of the north Italian architect Agostino Barelli who also designed Munich s Theatine Church. ',Germany
' Initially the Italianate Nymphenburg summer residence was a mighty cubic pavilion flanked by the court church several outbuildings and a small walled geometrical garden. By 1679 the palace complex in its first incarnation had nearly been finished. ',Germany
' Nymphenburg Palace acquired its present day dimensions under the elctor Max Emanuel  reigned 1680 1726 . Supervised by the court architect Henrico Zuccalli two off set pavilions were built on each side of the existing structure to the north and south. Begun in 1701 the pavilions were linked with the central edifice by galleries. ',Germany
' Nymphenburg Palace copperplate engraving by M. Wening 1701 ',Germany
' However the Spanish War of Succession soon put a stopp to construction work because Max Emanuel was again obliged to spend time outside Bavaria from 1704 to 1715. ',Germany
' When the Elector returned to Munich in 1715 he was accompanied by numerous French or French trained artists. As his palace complexes such as those in Dachau F rstenried Nymphenburg and Schlei heim were further enlarged these artists supplied works conforming to the latest French fashions. ',Germany
' Notable among them were the architect Joseph Effner and the garden artist Dominique Girard. But local painters also received important commissions. The views of the Bavarian Palaces in the galleries were executed by Franz Joachim Beich while among the stucco workers Johann Baptist Zimmermann was the leading light. So it was that the Munich court developed into one of Europe s foremost centres of the arts. ',Germany
' Nymphenburg Palace town side Maximilian de Geer around 1730  section  ',Germany
' About 1715 the court architect Joseph Effner together with the French landscape architect Dominique Girard designed an overall plan for Nymphenburg and the subsequent extension was carried out in accordance with this plan. ',Germany
' Of the measures that were implemented then the following are the most notable  the central pavilion as the focal point of the ensemble was redesigned the royal apartments were furnished and decorated the annexes situated in front of the main palace were rebuilt as residences for court officials and the crescent was constructed with a circular wall and five pairs of pavilions. Radiating out from the centre the perspectively off set structures fused to form a completely symmetrical ideal town which could accommodate the royal household. ',Germany
' After 1715 and following the plans of Dominique Girard and Joseph Effner the park was also redesigned and extended giving it its present dimensions and Baroque style. ',Germany
' Karl Albrecht first as Elector of Bavaria  reigned 1726 45  and then as Emperor Charles VII  from 1742 onwards  continued the construction work at Nymphenburg begun by his father. He enhanced the complex by adding the palace s crescent. Both palace and crescent were intended to form the centre of a planned Carlstadt  Charles Town . ',Germany
' Amalienburg Hall of Mirrors ',Germany
' His most precious legacy however is the Amalienburg in Nymphenburg s park. With this witty graceful Rococo gem Fran ois Cuvill s the Elder a Paris trained architect brought Munich court art to its peak of expression. Executed by pre eminent artists and specialist court workshops the Amalienburg now ranks among the most charming European architectural creations of the period. ',Germany
' Under Elector Maximilian III Joseph  reigned 1745 77  the Great Hall at Nymphenburg Palace acquired the opulent decoration that can be admired today. Here Johann Baptist Zimmermann together with Fran ois Cuvilli s the Elder created a major work of Munich court Rococo. The vaulted ceiling of the Palace Chapel was also painted. Finally under Max III Joseph the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory moved into its present quarters at the front of the palace. ',Germany
' At this time the park too was given a new look. The Grand Parterre was remodelled and adorned with statues of the most important gods of Olympus. The exterior flights of steps also date from this period and form a suitably representative entrance to the main building and Great Hall. ',Germany
' Nymphenburg Palace town side Bernardo Bellotto known as Canaletto 1761 ',Germany
' Elector Karl Theodor who ruled in Bavaria and the Palatinate from 1777 to 1799 changed little at Nymphenburg. He had the galleries widened to create new rooms which were furnished in the style of the day. In 1792 Karl Theodor opened the Nymphenburg palace park to the public. ',Germany
' Queen s study ',Germany
' When Bavaria became a kingdom in the early nineteenth century Nymphenburg resumed its important function. Elector Maximilian IV Joseph who as Maximilian I Joseph was the first King of Bavaria  reigned 1806 25  ordered some of the rooms to be redesigned and appointed with noble Neoclassical furniture. ',Germany
' The superintendent of the royal gardens Friedrich Ludwig Sckell tranformed the geometrical French gardens into a landscape garden in the English style. ',Germany
' King Maximilian I Joseph died at Nymphenburg in 1825. In subsequent years the palace remained a favourite residence of the Bavarian royal family. King Ludwig II of Bavaria  reigned 1864 1886  was born here on 25 August 1845. ',Germany

' It is raining hard and we are wondering whether it is really worth it  At first a visit to the fabled palaces of Sintra seemed perfect to spend a 12 hour layover at Lisbon Airport on the way travelling between West Africa and Berlin   after all UNESCO designated Sintra is only about an hour away from the airport. ',Germany
' But meanwhile we have read Nextbiteoflife s post on overtourism in Sintra and combined with the bad weather  and our clothing situation think Sandals and T Shirts  we are having second thoughts. On the other hand the tourist crowds shouldn t be such a problem on a rainy winter day  When we arrive just after 9 am at Sintra station the rain has stopped for the time being but the puddles on the street prove a challenge for our flimsy sandals and loafers. After all Northern Togo was around 40  C and no we didn t bring an umbrella on our West Africa travel   ',Germany
' Mediaeval palaces romantic atmosphere and a picturesque mountain village   we had read the travel guidebooks  descriptions but did not get any proper idea of what awaited us. Sintra is indeed relatively mountainous considering it s so close to the sea and on the rocky outcrop above the village the ruins of the Moorish castle are visible in dense clouds. Cute old houses are huddled on the side of the mountain. ',Germany
' To avoid the next bout of rain we hurry into the National Palace of Sintra an impressive mediaeval castle right in the village arranged in clusters of buildings around shady courtyards. The palace built from 1281 onwards on the remains of a Moorish castle combines sturdy gothic stone architecture with oriental fountains and round Moorish arches blue azulejo tiles with cuerda seca tiles on which the girih patterns are based on Islamic mathematicians  calculations. A number of student groups are pushing past us but in most rooms we find the space and time to look closely at the interior and exhibits. ',Germany
' A heavy downpour forces us to linger in the shop for a while before we dare to run to the bus stop right through the puddles. Again   with increasingly wet feet   we wonder whether it is worth going further up the hill to the Pena Palace in this weather. At least the bus is so full by the time it finally leaves that it gets relatively warm inside. Many serpentines later we emerge into the cloud and to the end of a queue at the ticket office only to wonder again whether this is really worth it or should we perhaps take the next bus down and go back to the airport  But then we reach the ticket window earlier than a decision on this matter   and hurry up through the Park of Pena towards the very top of the hill. That s about a ten minute walk during which we keep fearing another cold shower. ',Germany
' But when the Palace of Pena comes into view with its turrets and gates archways and balconies we stop questioning and debating that decision  or lack of decision . No the books hadn t prepared us for this great kitsch  ',Germany
' We stand in front of a romantic dream castle of a German aristocrat who built it in the 19th century and ordered his architect to incorporate as many architectural styles as possible from Germany and Portugal from the Middle Ages to the present. Dom Fernando II king of Portugal was a contemporary of the Bavarian King Ludwig II and his bonbon coloured castle in Sintra parallels the eclectic and romantic style of Ludwig s famous Neuschwanstein Castle. ',Germany
' On the inside as well it features a fascinating mix of Moorish mediaeval early modern Portuguese and impressionist styles with some Art Deco influences. ',Germany
' By now it is noon and considerably more visitors are lining up to peek into the rooms chapels and courtyards. Most of the time it is imperative to shuffle forward slowly so as not to disturb the flow of travellers and sightseers. Nevertheless we get a good view of the interior and by the time we get out of Pena Palace the fast moving clouds even leave some blue sky and occasional rays of sunshine   very welcome as we are by now seriously cold and shivering in our wet shoes. ',Germany
' Final questions  Are the castles of Sintra worth a visit  ',Germany
' Yes yes yes  And one day is not enough  There are more castles to explore than the National Palace and the Palacio de Pena. We will have to come back  And yes we caught a nasty cold on this trip. ',Germany
' How to get to Sintra from Lisbon ',Germany
' Sintra is easily reached by suburb train from Rossio or Oriente in around one hour s time. From the airport we took the subway to Oriente  three stations  and changed there. Within Sintra it would be time consuming but possible to walk. We took a local shuttle bus from the centre to the top of the mountain. The bus was 550   for the round trip the palaces 9   and 1150   respectively and that is for off season. ',Germany
' Oriene Station by Santiago Calatrava is a sightseeing item in itself ',Germany
'    Our travel to Sintra was entirely self organised and paid for by ourselves except for press tickets to the palaces courtesy of Parques de Sintra    ',Germany

' A frail old woman in black with a straw hat on top of her black headscarf walks down the road and then up again with a bag in her hand. She enters a house and moments later another door opens. The woman crosses the street and turns a corner. Seconds later she returns with a dog leashed by a cord around his leg. Only when we see two women at the same time do we realize that this deserted looking village is populated by at least four frail old women in black. ',Germany
' The southern coast of Portugal a steep but relatively sheltered coast compared to the storm swept cliffs in the west of Europe have seen many traders and settlers over the centuries  From Celtic nomads to Phoenician and Greek merchants. the Romans called the Province Lusitania the Arabs just Al Gharb the West. Later the great explorers of the 15th and 16th centuries started their journeys into the unknown from the small coastal town of Sagres and today tourists from every corner of Europe flock to the beaches of the Algarve. Yet few of the international comings and goings at the coast have affected the interior of the Algarve. The young people leave and only the old remain growing cabbage and oranges for their own consumption. Many farmers don t bother any more to pick the olives wine and almonds and most of the bare hills are being reforested with pine trees or fast growing Eucalyptus for the paper industry. ',Germany
' In Silves one of the larger villages in the backcountry restaurant owners put out tables hoping for a few day trippers from the holiday apartments along the coast and the souvenir shop half heartedly displays some cork hats cork note books and cork coasters. From Silves we walk again over lonely hills between gorse and Eucalyptus until the winds indicate that we are nearing the Cabo da Sao Vicente the south western tip of Europe with a powerful lighthouse and a steady trickle of visitors. This is the end of our hiking trip. We follow the day trippers into the coastal resorts which are deserted at this time of the year  Sagres Lagos Guia Albufeira   they all consist mainly of shuttered windows and empty hotels. A few restaurants and tour operators try to keep up a holiday atmosphere. We leave the steep cliffs and empty streets to the seagulls who seem to enjoy the November storms and head north for a few days of sightseeing in  vora and Lisbon. ',Germany

' For more photos of the Via Algarviana click here Hiking the Via Algarviana means not only geographically reaching the end of Europe. In the low developed backcountry of the Algarve time has stood still for centuries it seems. Tiny old women in black never seem to leave their villages. They grow olives and almonds use communal water pumps and those who are too far off to get meals on wheels spend their days in the village bar with a simple pre ordered lunch service and friendly greetings by the few customers. Apart from bread alcohol and black coffee hikers have to bring everything they need. ',Germany

' A short history of the Reichstag ',Germany
' The Reichstag is an internationally recognisable symbol of democracy and the current home of the German parliament. Every year thousands of guests visit the Reichstag   and with good reason  It is not often that you can enjoy such an amazing panorama while just beneath your feet the political decisions of tomorrow are being made. Both as an architectural wonder and a historical testimony the Reichstag has an important role to play in Berlin. ',Germany
' The original building is designed by Paul Wallot and modelled after the Memorial Hall in Philadelphia. Decorative motifs sculptures and mosaics are contributed by the artist Otto Lessing. The Reichstag is completed in 1894 although it doesn t acquire its iconic dedication to the German People  until 1916 when the words Dem Deutschen Volke are inscribed on its fa ade. At the time Kaiser Wilhelm II regards the building as the pinnacle of bad taste . The Reichstag serves as the home of the German parliament until 1933 when the building is badly damaged in a fire. This event marks the end of the Weimar Republic and provides a convenient pretext for Hitler to suppress dissent. Under Nazi dictatorship the building falls into neglect and is severely damaged during the Second World War. In 1945 it becomes one of the primary targets for the Red Army due to its perceived propaganda value. ',Germany
' After the war West Germany s parliament is relocated to Bonn and the building remains a virtual ruin until 1961 when a partial renovation is undertaken in the shadow of the newly erected Wall. Completed in 1964 this controversial restoration sees the building s interior and exterior stripped of the majority of its statuary. However the city makes efforts to retain the traces of its more recent history such as the bullet ridden fa ade and the graffiti left by the occupying Soviet soldiers. Throughout the cold war period and until the German reunification in 1989 the Reichstag is the site of a permanent exhibition Questions about German History  but otherwise sees only occasional ceremonial use. In 1990 the Reichstag is the site of the official reunification ceremony. After another year of intense debate it is decided that it will once again be the home of the German national parliament. In 1995 just prior to the commencement of Norman Foster s restoration of the building artist Christo and his wife Jeanne Claude wrap the Reichstag in fabric. Foster s careful restoration and redesign of the building is completed in 1999 and the new German government convenes at the Reichstag for the first time on April the 19th. ',Germany
' There is a certain irony in the fact that the building s glass cupola is not featured in Foster s original plans for the renovation of the Reichstag. The dome sits directly above the debating chamber. A mirrored cone at its centre directs light into the Reichstag increasing the building s energy efficiency and affording visitors a view of the parliamentary proceedings below. The dome itself can be visited by prior registration and is reached by two large steel ramps that curve up towards it in the form of a double helix. ',Germany
' Five fascinating facts about the Reichstag ',Germany
' Cyrillic graffiti left by Soviet soldiers after their siege of the Reichstag in 1945 has been carefully preserved and can be still seen by visitors today. ',Germany
' A true example of eco architecture the Reichstag is highly self sufficient in its production of energy. The shape of the dome allows the building to make use of natural lighting and ventilation which makes the building a unique symbol of sustainability. ',Germany
' The Reichstag is an important art venue. It has a considerable art collection and shows changing exhibitions as well as permanently installed artworks. ',Germany
' The roof of the Reichstag is home to the K fer Dachgarten Restaurant where guests with a prior reservation can enjoy a delicious breakfast lunch or dinner. Free panoramic view included  ',Germany
' Besides its eventful history Berlin is known to be a casual and friendly city. See for yourself on the grass in front of the Reichstag. This is a perfect place for picnics and a popular spot for sunbathing and relaxing. ',Germany
' What to see nearby when you visit the Reichstag ',Germany
' There are a number of important Berlin landmarks situated in the immediate vicinity of the Reichstag. The main railway station the Bundeskanzleramt and the Brandenburger Tor are all located a short walk away from the parliament building. You can also find a number of memorials nearby. These include the astounding Holocaust Memorial by Peter Eisenman that consists of 2711 concrete slabs arranged in a grid in which you can suddenly feel very disoriented and small. Another nearby memorial consisting of a circular pool commemorates the Sinti and Roma victims of National Socialism whilst a concrete cube containing a video memorialises the homosexuals persecuted under Nazism. ',Germany
' How to get to the Reichstag using public transport ',Germany
' The Reichstag is easily accessible by public transport as it is situated just a short distance from Berlin s main rail station the Hauptbahnhof.

' The first performance of the first opera in Verdi s legendary trilogia popolare at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice was preceded by a tricky battle with the censor. After all the play by Victor Hugo on which it was based about the cynical hedonism of an aristocrat had been a hot potato throughout Europe since 1832 when it was banned immediately after its first performance in Paris. Verdi was interested less in criticism of the ruling classes and more in the tragedy of the court jester whose existence is devastated. ',Germany
' The deformed entertainer in a world of men who consume women pulls out all the stops in his sarcasm and yet believes that he will remain unharmed by his public actions if he merely separates them cleanly from his private happiness. But when his daughter imprisoned in a remote location for her own protection follows her own longing she becomes the victim of his double existence. A lonely pitiable clown  An amoral petty bourgeois man thinks Arpad Schilling who dreams of innocence. A husband mourning for his wife and filled with a thirst for revenge. A great actor to whom success is more important than his own daughter. The fool of a noble lord who has been cheated by his own happiness. Verdi can do what Shakespeare does  He can tell a story in such a way as to make us shudder. ',Germany
' Rigoletto is the jester at the court of the Duke of Mantua. His speciality is making jokes at the cost of those who have been hurt by the the Duke. The Duke has a reputation as an insatiable lady killer who seduces the daughters and wives of his subjects. Rigoletto keeps his service at court completely separate from his private life. Nobody knows that he has an adult daughter whom he keeps hidden from society in the care of Giovanna. Gilda for her part knows nothing about what her father does outside their own four walls. Rigoletto s only concern is that he should not lose Gilda the apple of his eye. ',Germany
' Act One The Duke is celebrating a festivity devoted solely to his pleasure. He goes into raptures about an unknown girl whom he has been chasing for the last three months and whom he finally plans to conquer. For the time being however it is the Countess Ceprano to whom he is attracted. He pays court to her in front of her husband. The jealous Count Ceprano immediately becomes the object of Rigoletto s scorn. Someone comes in with an amusing piece of news  it is rumoured that Rigoletto has a young mistress whom he keeps hidden. When Rigoletto provocatively advises the Duke to have Count Ceprano executed so that he can amuse himself with his wife without being disturbed he does not only cause laughter. Count Ceprano finds plenty of support for his plan to have his revenge on the shameless jester. The festivities are interrupted by an uninvited guest  Count Monterone accuses the Duke of raping his daughter. Rigoletto pitylessly makes him the victim of his jokes upon which the injured father curses the Duke and Rigoletto. On his way to his daughter Rigoletto is haunted by the curse he cannot get it out of his mind. Sparafucile a professional assassin emerges out of the darkness and offers him his services. Rigoletto feels an affinity with this new acquaintance. It becomes clear to him just how much he hates his job and the Duke s court. Gilda tries to find out what is worrying her father but Rigoletto evades her questions about his name and her origins. When she wants to talk to him about her mother Rigoletto bursts into tears. Gilda has to comfort her father in his misery. Before he leaves again he impresses upon her that she must not leave the house except to go to church. Gilda is left with a bad conscience  she has not told her father that a young man regularly follows her to church. Giovanna puts her mind at rest. When Gilda admits that she is attracted to the unknown stranger Giovanna promptly allows him into the house. The Duke bombards Gilda with passionate declarations of love. When she asks him who he is he tells her he is a poor student. The happiness of the young couple is disturbed by voices in the street  the mob has gathered around Ceprano to kidnap Rigoletto s supposed mistress. Gilda is afraid that her father will return. She urges the Duke to flee. Gilda is left with a fictitious name which awakens all her longings. Rigoletto returns unexpectedly. The men in front of his house profess that they want to abduct Countess Ceprano and invite him to join them in their plan. Rigoletto agrees and accepts the strange conditions  which means that with his eyes bound he assists in the kidnapping of his own daughter. When he finds himself alone in the empty house he realizes that Monterone s curse has been fulfilled in the most catastrophic way. Act Two The Duke is disconsolate when he learns that Gilda has been kidnapped. He feels that through her he has become capable of true love. The kidnappers proudly tell him about the trick they have played on Rigoletto. The Duke realizes that they have actually brought the girl within his reach. He rushes to Gilda to prove his love for her. Rigoletto tries to find out something from the palace about what has happened to his daughter. Only with great difficulry can he hide his panic from the kidnappers. When he suspects that Gilda is with the Duke he almost breaks down the door to the latter s chamber. Gilda faces her father full of shame. She wants to tell him face to face what has happened. As far as Rigoletto is concerned it does not need many words to make it obvious that his daughter s honour has been lost. He swears he will take bitter revenge on the Duke. He does not listen to Gilda s begging him to forgive the Duke. Act Three Gilda cannot forget the Duke. In order to convince her of the Duke s unfaithfulness Rigoletto arranges for his daughter to secretly witness the Duke making advances to another woman. In an inn of dubious repute the Duke seeks his pleasure with Maddalena Sparafucile s sister. Gilda is forced to listen to the Duke whispering the same sweet words to Maddalena he had once used only for her ears. Rigoletto sends Gilda away. She is to leave the town disguised as a man. He commissions Sparafucile to murder Maddalena s client and pays him a deposit. He wants to have the corpse in his hands by midnight. A storm is brewing and Sparafucile offers his victim a room for the night. Contrary to her father s wishes Gilda returns. She eavesdrops on Sparafucile and Maddalena and thus learns that her beloved is to be murdered. Maddalena tries to talk her brother out of the murder. Sparafucile does not want to lose the money. He is prepared to make a deceitful compromise  if a stranger turns up before midnight he will kill him instead of the Duke. Gilda decides to sacrifice herself for the Duke. The murderer hands over the murdered man to Rigoletto on his return and receives his money. Rigoletto is rejoicing about the corpse when he hears the Duke in the distance singing his sarcastic little song about women s disloyalty. Horrified Rigoletto takes a closer look at the body and recognises his daughter. Gilda opens her eyes once again  she begs him to forgive the Duke and promises to pray for her father in heaven at her mother s side. Rigoletto begs his daughter not to leave him alone. In his despair he blames Monterone s curse for Gilda s death. ',Germany

' Solitude ',Germany
' The 11417 meters  7.1 mile  long public roads in the wooded countryside to the west of Stuttgart were used as the temporary race track Solitude between 1924 and 1965. The recreation area in the forests and the track was named after the nearby castle Schlo  Solitude which is situated 2 km to the north. ',Germany
' After WW II the Solitude featured several German Motorcycle GPs and non championship F1 races which attracted huge crowds of up to half a million people  The average in the last decade was said to be 288000 spectators and most of them probably had only a short walk from their home in the city of Stuttgart. ',Germany
' Legendary pilots like Geoff Duke John Surtees Wolfgang Graf Berghe von Trips Dan Gurney Jack Brabham or Jim Clark competed there. In addition the Solitude was used by Mercedes Benz and Porsche  both companies being based in Stuttgart  and NSU  the world s largest motorcycle factory in the 1950s  as a test track as it resembled the N rburgring  coincidentally the 11417 meters of the Solitude are exactly the half of the 22835 meters of the Nordschleife after the addition of Hohenrain chicane in 1967 . ',Germany
' Hans Herrmann GP driver for Mercedes Benz in the 1950s and Le Mans Winner 1970 in a Porsche 917 lives nearby in Magstadt. ',Germany
' The last race on the Solitude circuit was held in 1965 due to several reasons especially the questionable safety for pilots and spectators as there are almost no run off areas but a lot of trees next to the track. And between the trees and on the hills sides the spectators were placed. Keeping these crowds under control was a apparently a big problem  The 1962 program has 4 pages of recommendations rules and laws for spectator behaviour  Despite these threats the all time motorcycle record is said to be held by Mike the Bike Hailwood on a 500cc MV Agusta with an average of approx.160km h  100mph  in the rain. ',Germany
' The much safer permanent race track in Hockenheim which had to be rebuilt because of the new Autobahn A61 cut the old triangle circuit there in half was considered as replacement. Some of the first races in Hockenheim even were named Solitude GP. The new Hockenheim layout was designed by John Hugeholtz and has some similarities to the Solitude track  after a long and lonesome straight in the forest the pilots enter a crowded stadium like section with tight turns just like it used to be at B snau and Schatten. ',Germany
' As it always consisted of public roads the main part of the track can still be followed today speed limited to 60 or 80 km h though. People who travel on the A8 Karlsruhe Munich or come via Heilbronn on the A81 joining the A8 at Leonberger Dreieck can leave the Autobahn there at the Leonberg junction turn right and arrive almost immediately at the former Start Finish straight which is situated in the north western corner of the counter clockwise track. The trip with a full lap of the Solitude will only take about 16km and can be done in 20 minutes. ',Germany
' The oval shaped Zeitnehmerhaus tower on the left of the straight with Mercedes and Bosch written on it and the pits on the right side still exist. Also an ADAC Verkehrs bungsplatz  traffic exercise area  is located there in the infield area. To follow the counter clockwise track turn left at Seehaus corner to go past the Hotel Glemseck  a meeting place for motorcyclists  into the forest upwards to the Hedersbach Kurve which is a very steep and tight uphill right hand turn similar to Ex M hle at the N rburgring. The track continues to climb steeply  with 15  as steep as the Ring s famous Quiddelbacher H he Flugplatz  uphill in a section named Elend  misery certainly for pilots of low powered vehicles  and further up to Frauenkreuz. Here the track used to turn left and using a shortcut over a wooded hill the track used to drop down with a 11  gradient to join the main road again at Dreispitz. Continuing in the forest past the Lettenl cher a very fast section with some long sweeps and waves  somewhat similar to the old bumpy D ttinger H he at the Ring  leads past the Steinbachsee lake to the village of B snau. Here near the Hotel Schatten the track leads downhill in two sweeping U turns located in open meadows were motorbikers can exercise extreme leaning angles. After a sharp left turn the track enters the Mahdental valley with the Glems creek to the left and hills to the right. This 4 km long puzzling section in the forest with 10 left turns and 8 right turns was described by Phil Hill as being more difficult to learn and memorize than the whole N rburgring because all of the turns looked alike despite being quite different in radius and lenght. The trees on both sides of the constantly winding road limit the view ahead so even when cruising near the speed limit of 60km h one can have the impression of riding a bobsleigh down an ice tunnel. ',Germany
' Several memorial crosses along the road usually at the biker killing armco remind trespassers of fatal accidents. ',Germany
' In 1996 an Oldtimer festival with parading race cars was held on the start finish straight of the Solitude including Herrmann s Mercedes W196 and Porsche 917. ',Germany
' In 1998 the approx. 600 m long section between Frauenkreuz and Dreispitz was re nature ized  i.e. new trees were planted  in a trade off for the forest which was cut down during construction of the new nearby Autobahn Restaurant area Sindelfinger Wald. It is possible to take a short deviation outside of the forest and rejoin the original track at Dreispitz but the complete original layout is history now. Protests did not prevent it. ',Germany
' On Christmas of 1999 the storm Lothar knocked down a lot of trees in France and Germany and also many trees along the Solitude roads. This changed the impression one has when driving along the roads of the old race track. ',Germany
' Some facts about the Solitude race track  ',Germany
' The race track is a public road that was rebuilt in a joint venture of the State of Baden W rttemberg the State Capital Stuttgart the County of Leonberg and the Automobil Club section of ADAC Gau W rttemberg as a modern Test and Race Track for Automobiles and Motorcycles in the years 1952 to 56. ',Germany

' Horse and Power ',Germany
' In case someone wonders why a rather familiar looking black and yellow prancing horse sign is placed on the Solitude maps  This is the sign  Coat of Arms  of Stuttgart  which is derived from Stud Garden or horse farm . It is called R  le. Horses were breeded in the Stuttgart valley many centuries ago but nowadays Stuttgart is more known for its output of horse power.     The R  le which is also placed in the center of the Logo of Porsche is in official use for over 3 centuries. The cavallino rampante of a certain Italian car manufacturer which is said to have literaturally fallen from sky during World War I were it was used as the sign of a pilot is used since the 1930s by Enzo Ferrari.

' The Oriental adventures of Hermann von Puckler Muskau ',Germany
' Prussia s favourite dandy ',Germany
' Prince Puckler was one of the principal landowners in 19th century Prussia. Yet his passion for landscape gardening brought him to the brink of financial ruin. His literary career provided some monetary relief especially his travelogues which also led him on a journey to the Egypt of Muhammad Ali Pasha. By Christine Pfeilschifter ',Germany
' He had actually planned to journey to America next. But his trip was delayed by a duel in Paris in which he was victorious causing Prince Puckler to miss the departure of his ship. Instead he chose to tour the Orient and spent close to four years in the Middle East. ',Germany
' The story could not have been more in accord with the biography of the occasionally eccentric Prussian nobleman Prince Hermann von Puckler Muskau who was already a legend in his own time. ',Germany
' Born in 1785 at Muskau Castle Puckler was one of the principal landowners in the Prussian kingdom. He fought in the war of liberation against Napoleon and socialised with the personalities of his day including Goethe and the Brentano siblings. His colourful personality was underscored by such exploits as riding to Berlin in a carriage pulled by four tame stags. ',Germany
' Prince Puckler s prominent position within Prussian society was due in no small part to his wife Lucie von Hardenberg the daughter of Karl August von Hardenberg First Minister of Prussia. ',Germany
' Necessity is the mother of invention ',Germany
' The two were united by their love for landscaping and park design. After their wedding they planned to build the most extraordinary park in Prussia around Muskau Castle. They were beset by constant financial problems and in order to realise their plan the couple decided to legally dissolve their marriage in 1826 so that Prince Puckler might find a new rich bride in England. ',Germany
' Whimsical burial pyramid at Branitz near Cottbus  the eccentric landscape gardener Hermann von Puckler Muskau  1785 1871  had this pyramid   or tumulus   built to serve as his final resting place ',Germany
' The British however quickly saw through the prince s scheme and his three year search for a new wife came to nothing. Lucie Puckler found an escape from her financial plight by publishing the letters of her former husband under a pseudonym. In particular the scathing commentaries on British society in his Die Briefe eines Verstorbenen  Posthumous Letters  were hugely popular in Germany. ',Germany
' Nonetheless Lucie and Prince Hermann von Puckler Muskau soon faced renewed financial difficulties. He once again took up travelling   this time to North Africa and the lands of the eastern Mediterranean. In 1835 his journey led him from Paris to Marseille from whence he boarded a ship to Algiers. He then made his way through Tunisia to Egypt a region that still nominally belonged to the Ottoman Empire. The influence of the central authorities in Constantinople however was increasingly on the wane in the empire s peripheral regions especially those in North Africa. ',Germany
' Egypt under Mehemet Ali ',Germany
' The regional rulers treated the Prussian nobleman as a guest of state despite the purely private nature of his visit. In Tunisia for example the ruling Beys granted him the honour of visiting the Palace of Mohammedia which was then under construction. ',Germany
' Upon arriving in Egypt he even enjoyed a lively social exchange with Bogos Bey Minister of Foreign Affairs under Muhammad Ali Pasha and subsequently with the ruler himself. In his writings Puckler describes social conditions in Alexandria and Khahira present day Cairo in a fragmentary manner yet he still shows a certain propensity for detail. ',Germany
' He was particularly impressed by the Egyptian regional ruler Muhammad Ali Pasha whom he time and again defended in his book Egypt under Mehemet Ali. Puckler saw Egypt at the beginning of the 19th century as standing at the crossroads between the static Middle Ages and a new enlightened future. ',Germany
' Not out of character for an enthusiastic landscape designer he highlighted descriptions of scenery in his travelogues. Puckler felt that the factories and new polytechnic schools were just as much a part of Egypt s landscape as the antiquities of ancient Egypt and the peasants in the fields. ',Germany
' Slave turned mistress  if Machbuba was initially regarded by Puckler as an object of research   a noble savage still untouched by civilisation   in time she became his mistress and eventually accompanied him back to Prussia ',Germany
' Prince Puckler journeyed from Khahira along the Nile and visited the ancient Egyptian temple complexes along the river. Taking the Blue Nile he finally reached Senna in Sudan from whence after suffering a protracted bout of illness he was forced to return home. ',Germany
' Puckler s slave Machbuba ',Germany
' He was accompanied on his return voyage by a small entourage of servants as well as a young girl who he had bought at a slave market. Machbuba in all likelihood originally from Abyssinia was only about 14 years old. ',Germany
' Prince Hermann Puckler conceded that it was not fitting for a free Prussian to own a slave. Almost as soon as the deal was struck he informed Machbuba through an interpreter that she was free   a concept the young girl obviously could not fathom. Still he did not hesitate to savagely punish her whenever she failed to obey him. ',Germany
' If Machbuba was initially regarded by Puckler as an object of research   a noble savage still untouched by civilisation   in time she became his mistress and eventually accompanied him back to Prussia. Machbuba died soon after she arrived in Germany and was buried in Muskau where her grave is cared for to this day. ',Germany
' Following his return to Prussia in late 1839 Puckler published his travel diaries. The success of his books however only alleviated his financial difficulties for a short time. In 1845 he was forced to sell Muskau Castle and his beloved park. He moved to Branitz Palace which also belonged to his family. ',Germany
' There he created a new park featuring a lake at its centre with a small island  here beneath a grassy pyramid of his own design he was laid to rest. ',Germany

' Members of the BBC Scottish Symphony performing at the tea lounge of the Taj Palace on April 2 ',India
' As the records of Gaelic Storm and Dubliners at my pad would profess I have a special corner in my heart reserved for symphonies that emerge from hills and dales of Scotland  and Ireland if you please . Therefore an invitation to a performance by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at the Tea Lounge of Taj Palace   no less   seemed like a golden opportunity come knocking in a kilt of Tartan patterned wool.

' A 65 member band in its 80th year the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra had come to India for the first time as part of a three city tour. Assembled at the venue sipping tea and sparkling wine were a number of music aficionados from Delhi s elite circles   clearly making the most of a beautiful evening. And then when they had ascertained that all eyes were on them the band began to play. ',India
' And play they did grabbing hold of the audience s imagination and taking it on a frolicking ride of the English countryside on the body of the flute and the clarinet. I perked up my ears lest they miss any note of melody wafting past and almost failed to notice the attendant asking me if I would like something to munch on. Now music may be food for the soul but it isn t prudent to deny the stomach its lot either. Especially the kind they were offering on the occasion. ',India
' To accompany the ensemble with a touch of Indian regality the Tea lounge had introduced the Maharaja Afternoon Tea   a spread of decadent proportions that promised just the right notes as far as gastronomy was concerned. Among the delicacies on offer were Baked Chocolate Tarts a selection of mouth watering Sandesh and Tomato Avocado Sandwiches   to name a few besides a wide selection of estate teas and single origin coffees.

' Preferring to start on a sober note I opted for Darjeeling white tea and noted how even subtlety can leave a lasting impression on your taste buds. And truth be told it s the best drink to go with an orchestral performance. ',India
' Barely a few moments into the event the crowd fell into rapt silence and I could see why. The music seemed to reflect the moods of a bipolar man  only a lot more beautiful    plucking at your heart strings at one moment but caressing them at another  rising to a thunderous crescendo and falling almost as suddenly  painting the picture of sheep frolicking in a pasture at one moment before turning into a mournful tune that could just as well have been a dirge. And as colourful images painted by violins cellos flutes and clarinets fill your mind you realise that if a picture is worth a thousand words a beautiful melody has to be worth half a million.

We stopped at Stirling castle and again Paul provided us with some idea of how best to explore the castle the not to miss things and let us spend our time exploring. He offered the guided tour but we opted to take it in on our own. We finished the day with a drive by of Dounne Castle...Paul explained the pop culture significance of this castle Monty Python and Outlander...we opted to skip the tours and went to Deanston distillery instead and were not disappointed.

' My wife her parents and myself booked a 4 night 5 day tour with Paul a few weeks ago. We were doing a trip of the UK and really wanted to explore the Scottish Highlands without driving ourselves on the wrong side of the road into an accident  He picked us up from our hotel in Edinburgh in the morning. We then proceeded to stay off the major highways for the majority of our trip until we were dropped off at the Inverness Airport 5 days later. Paul catered the tour to our interests keeping us off the beaten bath and through the Scottish country side. We went from Edinburgh to the Isle of Mull on the first day staying at a charming bed and breakfast in Tobermory a small fishing village overlooking the harbor. Paul made multiple stops at lochs standing stones and castle ruins along the way. His knowledge of Scottish history and way of life was astounding. Rarely was he not able to answer our questions. A storm blew in on the isle so our day at sea whale watching was cancelled but that didn t stop Paul from giving us a wonderful tour around the island. We then took the fairy back to Oban to spend our second night. Paul then drove us up the west coast of Scotland to Inverness stopping to see Glencoe the Harry Potter viaduct and train Loch Ness and multiple castle ruins along the way. We then stayed in Inverness for our last 2 nights in Scotland. Paul picked us up both mornings. We toured Craggenmore distillery highlands Zoo Chanonry point Fort George a sheep dog demonstration Culloden castles and standing stones over our last 2 days. By the end of the trip Paul had become a true friend and a member of our clan. He has a wonderful sense of humor and is a phenomenal tour guide. We wouldn t have seen half of the things we did in Scotland if it wasn t for him. We will recommend him to all of our friends family and if we ever get back to beautiful Scotland we will definitely use his services again. P.S. Paul you were right. We enjoyed our time in Scotland more than any other part of our trip. It truly is the jewel of the UK  Cheers   ',India

' The palace has literally nothing and also very small in size. It looks amazing only from the outside and from the inside it is just average as it has only one hall covering the whole palace. But the view from the place is so amazing. You can view the whole of Udaipur from there including lake Pichola. I would say it is worth traveling up there just for the view and don t expect anything else there. ',India
' Also you can reach the palace which is on the hilltop only either by car or two wheelers. The auto rickshaws are not allowed up the hill. So you can rent a bike in Udaipur  as there are many  hire a cab or reach the bottom of the hill in the auto and rent a scooty from the auto stand  it is not an actual bike renting company but just some people who earn by renting their own bike  for which they charge around Rs. 350. But to be on the safe side just hire a bike from the city itself if you don t want to spend on cab. ',India

' The Darjeeling Mountain Railway. Photo  Christopher Pillitz ',India
' 1 10 ',India
' The Golden Chariot ',India
' Route  Bengaluru to Goa It s not unusual to find luxury trains full of Western tourists too scared to attempt the real railways but this service is a popular choice with Indian families on holiday. Cutting across Karnataka the train stops at Kabini wildlife sanctuary before arriving at the World Heritage sites of Hampi and Badami. Strewn for miles with boulders rock cut sandstone caves and palace and temple ruins the sites can take hours to examine by foot so it s nice to have a hot shower a cool cabin and a fresh cup of tea on your return. Sit by your window the evening before arriving in Goa and watch the sun stream through the forests before setting behind the hills. Journey time  7 nights 8 days ',India
' Goa Express ',India
' Route  Vasco da Gama Goa to Londa Karnataka Take a seat by an open window and watch a botanical slideshow play as this express train rattles past bursts of blossom. On the other side of these low hanging blooms is the ocean crashing against the shore as families splash and squeal in the waters. On the approach to the Western Ghats the train clanks past rocky terrain threaded with the silver lines of waterfalls. Olive green bodies of water shift quietly below bridges and swaying palms tower over whitewashed villas of the countryside. Journey time  3 hours 25 minutes ',India
' Pune Hazrat Nizamuddin Duronto Express ',India
' Route  Pune to New Delhi It might not sound like a lot but the twice weekly Duronto Express from Pune to Delhi cuts six hours off the normal 26 hour journey. From 11am until sunset the train takes in some of the most varied topography in the country. Sitting in an open doorway passengers can watch as the train travels over riverbeds blasts through bone dry deserts and sails past pyramid like salt mounds drying in the sunshine. Journey time  20 hours ',India
' Kalka Shimla Express ',India
' Route  Kalka to Shimla At a speed of 16 kmph this toy train takes just over five and half hours to climb from Kalka to Shimla rolling through 102 tunnels over 87 bridges and bending around 900 curves. Built in 1903 when the gentry of the Raj would take their leave of the heat and summer  in Shimla the train is now used by commuters and those selling their wares up and down the hillside rather than being overrun by tourists with selfie sticks. As Shimla approaches orchards bloom with tiny red flowers and thin streams of water run over rock ledges suggesting that post monsoon waterfalls must be rife. The train stops regularly en route so passengers can loiter in the shade and enjoy tea and freshly fried pakoras. Journey time  5 hours 35 minutes ',India
' The Indian Odyssey ',India
' Route  CSTM Mumbai to New Delhi Once the ruler of India s railways the Palace on Wheels has now been dethroned by a younger model. The Indian Odyssey connects Mumbai and Delhi via the Golden Triangle and is the closest option to travelling like the Rajput kings once did. Much like a cruise on wheels the train travels overnight and parks at stations during the day allowing passengers to disembark for coach trips to Ellora Ajanta the Taj Mahal and even tiger spotting at Ranthambore. Onboard activities include watching Octopussy from under a crisp white duvet dining in a choice of beautiful cars or sipping Bombay Sapphire while the Thar desert blasts by the window. Journey time  7 nights 8 days ',India
' Kamakhya Ledo Intercity Express ',India
' Route  Tinsukhia to Ledo Assam Running along the easternmost segment of Indian Railways this morning passenger train blasts past miles of low plump tea bushes washed clean by the night s rain. Dotted with the bent backs of tea pickers the green expanse soon narrows into villages. Blaring its horn for minutes at a time the train squeezes frighteningly close to the road where sapota sellers squat at the track s edge before running parallel to a strip of homes close enough for you to peer over the walls and watch as mothers oil their children s hair on the kitchen steps. Journey time  1 hour 45 minutes ',India
' The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway ',India
' Route  Darjeeling to New Jalpaiguri Darjeeling s steam train was initially built as a tramway to exploit the difference in the price of potatoes between Darjeeling and Siliguri and the hill railway is now deemed a World Heritage Site. Travelling at a speed of 12 kmph the sweet little blue train trundles through dense forests curving around tea plantations and bringing passengers as close as possible to the tea pickers with baskets strapped across their foreheads. Famous for its reverses loops and the spiral at Agony Point the railway eventually bisects the main road near Ghum and runs alongside fruit stalls in the street. On a clear day you can see the snow capped tip of Kanchenjunga. Journey time  6 hours 30 minutes ',India
' The Island Express ',India
' Route  Kanyakumari to Thiruvananthapuram Kanyakumari the southernmost tip of India where the three oceans meet is a fine spot to begin a mammoth train journey. But for those who want to simply test the waters the Island Express is a short trip that crawls through dense greenery tightly packed palms and long grassy verges. Filling with a lemony green hue from the foliage that cradles the carriages the train offers one of the best ringside views into Kerala s village life. Giant creepers curl down from the jungle like expanse and if you look carefully you ll spot pink and blue churches and pretty little houses painted like sugared almonds. Journey time  2 hours 35 minutes ',India
' The Mandovi Express ',India
' Route  CSTM Mumbai to Madgaon Goa Lying along India s southwest coastline the Konkan Railway is flanked by the majesty of the Sahyadri hills on the east and the Arabian sea on the west. The British once considered its construction but abandoned the task leaving it to Indian engineers to bore through mountains and negotiate rivers in a feat of excellence comprising 92 tunnels and 2000 bridges including the Panvalnadi viaduct one of the highest in India. This train rolls past jungles of palm thick tangles of coconut trees lakes and rivers and is home to the finest dining car on Indian Railways. From the moment you board you are invited to fresh pakoras fluffy biryani vadas deep fried chicken lollipops and endless cups of treacle sweet tea. Journey time  13 hours ',India
' Jammu Mail ',India
' Route  Jammu to Udhampur Construction of this 53km stretch of railway from Jammu to Udhampur has extended the northernmost reach of the Indian Railways into the foothills of the Himalayas. Weaving around the rocky faces of the Shivalik mountain range travelling high above wide mouthed rivers and plunging valleys the train ride involves more than 20 tunnels and 158 bridges with a spectacular view from Gambhir bridge. On the approach to Udhampur the land flattens out into something resembling English meadows. And if you re waiting for the frequently delayed train the station restaurant at Jammu Tawi does one of the best omelette sandwiches on the whole of Indian Railways.

This continues for six long minutes and finally the cougar runs away. ',India
' According to Kyle s post he was on the trail when he thought he had found bobcats who are known to not attack humans. However they turned out to be cougar cubs. Their mother who stalked Kyle for six long minutes was not happy when he saw him and started following him. ',India

' Varanasi was found to be the cleanest among cities along the river Ganges in the Sanitation Ranking list of the Swachh Survekshan 2020 held in over 4000 cities and towns in the country. However an image of a road dug up and filled with sewage water is viral on social media with the claim that it is from Varanasi. ',India

' Prime Minister Narendra Modi s parliamentary constituency Varanasi was found to be the cleanest among cities along the river Ganges in the Sanitation Ranking list of the Swachh Survekshan 2020 held in over 4000 cities and towns in the country. ',India
' While Varanasi was awarded the Cleanest Ganga Town an image of a road dug up and filled with sewage water is viral on social media with the claim that it is from Varanasi. ',India
' The text superimposed on one such image uploaded on Facebook reads BJP government has turned Benares into London.  ',India
' India Today Anti Fake News War Room  AFWA  has found that the claim to be false. The image is from Sangam Vihar an informal settlement in South Delhi. ',India
' The archived version of similar posts can be seen here and here. ',India
' AFWA Probe ',India
' With a reverse image search we found that a similar image has been viral on social media at least since the year 2018 with the claim that it is from Delhi. ',India
' We found multiple posts carrying the image in question on Twitter in January 2020. The posts criticise Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for neglecting the Delhi roads. ',India
' Another post from 2018 carrying a similar image with the same shops and surroundings has mentioned that the photo is of Ratiya Marg in Sangam Vihar New Delhi. ',India
' A closer look at the image helped us identify one of the signboards of a cake shop in the photo   Ansh Cake Palace. ',India
' When AFWA reached out to the owner of the shop Deepak Arora he confirmed to us that the image is from street number eight of Ratiya Marg at Block D of Sangam Vihar in New Delhi. ',India
' The image is from Sangam Vihar. However the photograph is at least a few months old. The road was broken for the construction of stormwater drains that time. But that work never happened and the condition of the road is still more or less the same  he said. ',India
' Arora also shared with us some photographs exhibiting the current condition of the road in Ratiya Marg. ',India
' We were also able to geolocate the shop at Ratiya Marg on Google Maps. ',India
' Also there are articles by Down To Earth and DNA that discusses the faulty stormwater drains in Sangam Vihar which is Delhi s largest unauthorised colony. ',India
' Hence it is safe to say that the viral image of a road in a poor condition is from Ratiya Marg of Sangam Vihar in New Delhi and not is not related to Varanasi. ',India
' ClaimImage shows dug up road filled with sewage water in PM Modi s Parliamentary constituency Varanasi   also recently awarded the Cleanest Ganga Town.ConclusionThe claim is misleading. The road in question is from Sangam Vihar Delhi s largest unauthorised colony and the photograph has been on the Internet since 2018. ',India

' Gully Boy is imperfect. But go watch the Zoya Akhtar film ',India
' Gully Boy starring Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt hit the screens on February 14. Despite its imperfections the film deserves to be watched. ',India
' Gully Boy starring Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt hit the screens on February 14. Despite its imperfections the film deserves to be watched. ',India
' Zoya Akhtar has often been accused of chronicling the life of the elite and luxurious with special regard to her films Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Dil Dhadakne Do. In her latest film Gully Boy starring Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt she has left picturesque European countryside scenes aside and plunged straight into the dusty and chaotic Mumbai slums and crafted a story of two strong protagonists battling class oppression and social inequality with their religious identity carefully foregrounded throughout the narrative. ',India
' While rap music serves as the ultimate outlet and frees the soul from pain and torment Gully Boy speaks most in its lyrical silences. ',India
' THE TALE OF THE UNDERDOG ',India
' Murad  played by a dynamic Ranveer  is a college goer who lives with his dysfunctional family in the densely populated Dharavi slum of Mumbai. He goes about his day quietly and at night scribbles his feelings in a notebook while his parents fight it out as his father has brought a new bride home. His father played by a fantastic Vijay Raaz does not support his dreams of course and is ready to get physically violent with him if need be. ',India
' Brought up in a culture of daily violence Murad s rap becomes a venting outlet to express anger in a non violent manner. It gives him strength to face the abuse at home and it slowly becomes his weapon. The evolution of Murad s character from the beginning till the end of the film is clearly seen. Akhtar makes no pretences about showing the inception of hip hop in Mumbai. Instead she uses rap as the window for the suppressed. ',India
' Gully Boy attempts to trace how he rises back up every time  he is hit in the face metaphorically and literally. While the tale of the underdog is nothing new in the world of cinema Zoya Akhtar gives this story a refreshing feel and your heart does ache for Murad at points. It instills a feeling of hope and belief in you that yes obstacles can be overcome. Dreams can be fused seamlessly into reality. The film s anthem  Apna Time Aayega  makes you chant it under your breath as well. ',India
' And so Gully Boy leaves you with a feeling of hope. ',India
' FLESHED OUT CHARACTERS ',India
' Be it Murad s friends his strong willed mother played Amruta Subhash his mentor MC Sher  Siddhant Chaturvedi  most of the supporting characters have a distinct personality of their own. They ensure that they make the best of their screen time and are not just ornamental purposes. Of course Alia Bhatt cannot be glossed over in this regard. ',India
' Often filmmakers focus on the male persona and keep the female counterpart just as a supportive girlfriend who steals kisses between scenes. But we forget that is Alia who has proved her worth in the film industry. She gives an electrifying performance as Safeena and makes the best use of her limited screen time. ',India
' Safeena isn t just a normal girlfriend in the background. She has dreams of establishing her clinic and puts that even before marrying her own boyfriend. In one scene Murad asks her I come second  She laughs and tells him to take what he gets. She doesn t back down and is ready to beat up any girl who tries to make flirtatious comments to her boyfriend. Alia provides the comic element in the film with her possessive one liners and her sweet white lies to her parents. She has her own struggles as well and that is well encapsulated when she tells her parents that she wants a life of her own rather than the one they have set for her. ',India
' The film benefits enormously from Ranveer and Alia s crackling chemistry and the two are able to feed off each other s artistic energies and give Murad and Safeena an old fashioned romantic tale. ',India
' Though he mysteriously disappears into the background towards the end of the film Siddhant Chaturvedi gives an overpowering debut as MC Sher who mentors and guides Murad through the business of rapping. ',India
' The only disappointment is Kalki who shines in her offbeat films and is always relegated to the sidelines in mainstream films. ',India
' MUSIC ',India
' Armed with just his words Ranveer is unstoppable. Ironically even for those who aren t rap enthusiasts you can t help feel his infectious energy and enthusiasm. He has the ability to communicate his pain with his songs and just his eyes. Songs like Apna Time Aayega and Gully Mein leave you cheering and hooting. ',India
' Each word has a meaning and is not there for flummery decoration. Ranveer sinks his teeth into his character and takes the story forward with his music. You do get the feeling as if he has internalized the pain of living in the slums. Once again Ranveer gives the performance of a lifetime. ',India
' However dealing with such senstive topics is not a cakewalk and Akhtar falters along the way in her attempt to address subjects such as domestic abuse and class bias. Some solutions come easy in the end and in the typical Bollywood esque way a lifelong abusive father turns emotional when he sees his son taking the stage by storm. Some storylines including Murad s friend Moeen who hijacks cars for a living  with the song Azadi in the background  are fused into the story and not given adequate explanation. ',India
' However despite its occasional slow pace and shortcomings Gully Boy deserves to be watched. The acting is powerful the filmmaking is seductive and the music keeps your feet tapping. ',India
' Gully Boy has Bollywood s favourite tropes like the tale of the underdog the over possessive girlfriend and discouraging parent. Yet it is packaged in a refreshing way and deserves to be watched with all its imperfections. It does what we would like cinema to do for us occasionally. It makes us hope even it s for a little bit.

' This intriguing plan depicts Old Delhi  as it appeared during the Great Uprising of 1857 Delhi as depicted here was founded in 1638 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in order to serve as his new capital city. Named as Shahjahanabad it was comprised of seven square miles enclosed by great walls. The city was dominated by the colossal Red Fort the imperial palace constructed in 1648 that straddles the Jumna  Yamuna  River in the lower part of the plan. The rest of the city was composed of a dense warren of streets interrupted by a few broad avenues fine gardens and magnificent mosques. ',India

' Lutyenss plan literally projects British imperial power over the existing Indian landscape. A profoundly powerful image it shows in bold red lines the network of broad boulevards running between grand edifices literally overwhelming all aspects of the countryside which is presented in pale blue. Indeed the new imperial city literally bulldozed ancient villages and ploughed over farms that had been worked for centuries. At the same time it strategically preserved an integrated import Mughal monuments such as Humayun s Tomb into the new city symbolically legitimising British power by showing it as the rightful successor to the Mughal imperial mantle.

' A masterpiece of early Indian lithography and colouring and an exquisite rendering of the important Schalch Princep survey of Calcutta  ',India
' The map provides an extremely detailed portrayal of Calcutta which was then the capital of the Company Raj  and India s preeminent commercial and cultural centre with a population of almost 200000. The city proper comprised of densely populated urban blocks coloured in red is confined by the Hooghly River and the New Circular Canal. The great citadel of Fort William built between 1757 and 1764 rises out of the middle of the Esplanade on the south side of town. True to European Enlightenment era urban models Calcutta is traversed by several broad thoroughfares although by contrast most of the city is comprised of narrow curving streets and alleyways common to many traditional Indian cities.

' The most detailed and accurate early map of Bangalore and one of the finest plans depicting a major Indian city prior to the influences of contemporary European urban planning  ',India
' This fascinating map of Bangalore grants a magnificent impression of a sizeable Indian city prior to it being influenced by European urban models. The large pettah in the upper centre is encircled by an elaborate system of walls and takes on an overall ovoid shape common to many such Indian cities. Within are dense and uneven blocks divided by narrow streets a labyrinth which was ideal to confuse potential invaders who dared to storm the city. A connecting ovoid palace fort complex projects off of the main pettah to the south. ',India

' It was a place worth to be. Lansdwone being a smal hill station we enjioyed our stay at Ravine Palace with wonderful staff and amenities for indoor games as well..i travellled with my 2 kids and was a comfortable stay at this hotel.. food was also good. ',India
' I stayed there along with mine family for 3 nights . Talking about Hotel  it looks awesome   Newly constructed. It s about 6km before Lansdowne but all nice hotels are like this only . There are no good hotels in main town. It s very clean with simple but nice interiors . The rooms have individual balconies with Valley facing  Few are road facing also we choose valley facing  . Housekeeping   Restaurant guys are all good   helpful without any fuss. In our case  unfortunately 1 day mine daughter   1 day mine health was not well however they helped us really well by going out of the way in arranging medicines as well as doctor . Food was nice   delicious. Only 1 issue which I feel is regarding network availability at hotel. Only BSNL   JIO comes   you are totally dependent on WIFI which also is not that fast . Upon checking with Hotel  came to know that it s because of Govt  Telecom companies haven t put any Tower over there . This situation is there with all the hotels over there  hence sometimes if you have any urgent work   official  personal  you have to use Hotel Landline   I used it once . They were accomdating in that also  so I really felt happy with their behavior towards their guests . They do have few indoor games also to play like TT  Snooker etc which is also good . Overall will definitely recommend everyone to plan a stay at this Hotel while visiting lansdowne.   ',India

' I visited this place along with my family and friends  15 in total adults and children  during 2010 Diwali and the only disappointment was absence of lake  which once existed.. now a nallah far away . The palace is huge well maintainedvery clean and decor is very ethnic. Since it was a diwali time so we were the only guest in palace so felt like we were the owner with all privacy. We even met owner who came down to palace for diwali puja. That time they were developing fish farming and hope should be ready by now. Kids were excited to see fish farming. Food was very tasty and service was good. ',India

' Dear Sir Thank you for your detailed feedback and for being kind to provide us with the details of your experience and generous ratings following your stay with us last diwali. While we are glad to enjoyed the ethnic decor of the palace and meals prepared by our chef as most of the vegetables served in our farms are grown in our organic farms within the hotel premises. With reference to your comments regards to the lake please note that we do not guarantee that there will be water in the lake at all times as it s a natural lake and the water in the lake is subject to rain. I am sure you will surely return for a longer duration and give us a chance to serve you again. Best Wishes Surya Pratap Singh ',India
' We had been going on the highway for quite sometime and planning a stopover for lunch when we spotted this place like an oasis in the desert. this is a very well maintained place  true to Rajasthani style. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous. The artifacts in the place were lovely. We stayed only for lunch but rooms also seemed good with nice view. ',India

The chef is poor in making non veg dishes. 4. Penny pinching   even charged for the local dance show 5. Less transparent  tried to pass off service charges as tax 6.

' As I reached Umaid lake palace Dausa and threw a glance at its majestic building I was bit disappointed. There seemed to be no maintenance of the otherwise beautifully designed building. But the moment I entered it I was thrilled to note the exquisite stone work done in it. Every wall floor railing pillar ceiling step was decorated beautifully and it was a treat to the eyes. The majestic building has a long length of fountains in front of it exactly like the Taj Mahal concept. Even a platform has been created with a bench on it for capturing couple photographs again like Taj Mahal. Inside the two storeyed building there is restaurant and rooms at first floor while only rooms and suites exist at ground and second floor. You can stay even in tents provided in the premises if you like that. Most comfortable stay at reasonable rates though meals provided are under limited menu and not much variety is there. What appalled me most in the restaurant was that there is no control on house flies that swarm over every dish with waiters not bothering for the same. The hotel could easily tackle the problem by covering every dish with a transparent malmal cloth. Overall Umaid provided an unforgettable experience that I will remember for long for the joy it provided. Their holi function was memorable and worth its extra cost.   ',India

' What makes this property worth visiting is the expanse of the property and the service. Nestled ahead of Dausa   70kms from Jaipur is a quiet very well maintained property. The gardens are well maintained service is attentive with a good and clean environment and pool However the good part ends there. The rooms for the price are very average. The larger room size makes up for the very basic amenities. They seem to have cut corners in the room but that is what the Hotel is charging for   The food quality is not good and is a lot to be desired. Suggest to stick to basics of Daal roti and subzi. We ordered kadai paneer however the preparation was really bad. Similarly with Veg Biryani. The basic sustenance food of lentils roti is recommended. The price per dish is 300  onwards and with the quality served it seems money down the drain The hotel seems to be suffering from COVID repercussions but given the vast property it has the potential to do better. Would I recommend based on my experience definitely NO    ',India

' From the moment you arrive at Talabgaon Castle you are blown away by the beauty of the restored fort. Every turn you take there is something different to wow you. All the rooms are unique in style but every single one is beautiful as we explored a few of the rooms all in keeping with the traditional architecture and of a large size. The gardens are amazing and well kept and the staff  despite their little English  are friendly and welcoming throughout. The rooms smell beautiful scented by fresh rose petals. All the main meals we had were incredibly tasty. There is so much potential with this hotel to do even more  afternoon tea would have been nice or even a spa. We also took a walk into the village and the children ate so polite  so different to the other places we have visited in India where you feel harassed at times. However there were some downsides including the very poor WiFi connection and very poor shower water pressure especially in the morning  though I did put this down to being in a remote location. The breakfast was very dry and cold too which was surprising considering the other two meals were delicious. Overall though this was still one of our highlights of our trip to India and I would recommend staying here.   ',India

' My very very favourite hotel on our group tour of Golden Triangle. What an experience  The setting is picture perfect the rooms outstanding and the hospitality second to none. Only regret that we only stayed one night. ',India
' The restored Palace has retained its original grandeur with rooms that that give the wow factor when first seen. Located within a rural village the contrast is extreme with how the locals live that can initially be a shock and an embarrassment. However the castle provides much needed employment for the community and where the local shops benefit from the tourist income. A walk through the village is essential to help understand India and the locals are welcoming especially the children. The food at the accommodation is good with the evening meal being served outside with a local troupe providing traditional musical and dancing entertainment. A special experience that is highly recommended. ',India

' Stayed with a friend at Aman Bagh for three nights. Superb property with blessings of nature... tall trees chirping birdsmelodious sound of fluteparrots playing hide ans seek  dancing blue water of pools... what else one can long for.welcome was with sweet Sanskrit chant and farewell with curd and jaggery... stayed in pool villa with separate area for washrooms and change... Food was superb with great service and hospitality. Massage in spa was very relaxing. Every corner of property forces you to keep on clicking. In spite of this found few flaws... 1. Toilet area doesn t have hand shower. Every time had to carry water bottle 2. No hand support rod in bathroom which is a must for senior citizens 3. At night it was difficult to step out of villa as it was too dark. No path lights. We had to take dinner inside room only 4. Private pool area not maintained at all. I was there for four days but no one came to clean pool even for once. 5. Driver accommodation is very far  12 13 Km  from resort which should be somewhere near the resort Still we enjoyed a lot. Would love to go again.   ',India

' We were recommended Amanbagh by Mr Anand Shekhawat during our stay at Aman i Khas in November 20 and safe to say we had the greatest experience at Amanbagh during the new years eve. From the moment you arrive you just know you are at an Aman property could be the traditional welcome with flowers and a beautiful Sanskrit chant or the manager being there to personally welcome you but there is a feeling of peace and home  that greets you as soon as you enter an Aman property. The activities during the day   local bangle makers and henna artists kept us entertained and intrigued while the harmonious sound of a live flute floated through the air and the atmosphere could not have been more tranquil. The new years eve dinner and entertainment were beautifully arranged in the courtyard and were anything short of extraordinary as thousands of diyas lit up the evening sky and the soulful voices of the local singers led to an extraordinary evening which was topped by exemplary service by the entire staff. I believe this was our first new years celebration where we did not have to check the time and when the clocked ticked 12 we were pleasantly surprised. The local musicians make one feel a certain connection to the world that never fades away. After a wonderful evening the morning of 1st January was made even special by camel polo in the front lawns. It was a completely new experience for us and was a wonderful start to the first day of the year. It goes without saying that the staff at Amanbagh is always looking for ways to make you feel comfortable and plan beautiful surprises to make your stay even special. It is in these small but meaningful gestures that one falls in love with Aman properties. All in all we would like to give our compliments to the spirited GM Mr Hemendra for being such a positive presence and to the entire staff of Amanbagh. We can t stop talking and reminiscing about our time at both the Aman properties and look forward to being back soon.  ',India

' I had only heard about the experience of an Aman Hotel and let me tell you that during my recent visit to Amanbagh it surpassed whatever I had heard. Everything from the beauty and location of the hotel the peace and tranquillity we enjoyed during the first two days  till the hotel got packed  the level of service starting from Hemendra Singh the dashing GM of the hotel to Chef Ram Divya and of course our own personal butler   Vikram. They created dining experiences for us each of them etched for lifetime in our memory. The dinner at the 16th century Chatri  was surreal   You have to experience it because words or a picture will never justify it. The villas are lovely   spacious comfortably designed warm and the bathrooms are the size of a villa by themselves. The villa pool is an experience not to be missed and should you decide to want complete privacy it does offer so. Chef Ram can cook up a storm starting from western cuisine to Asian and of course Rajasthani. Hemendra and his staff made us feel so welcome that we can t wait to go back soon.  ',India

' Experience at OYO related to app shortlisting of property user friendly app rates .. was best. For the hotel Chand palace at cannaught palace new delhi I must say its hotel staff is full of DACOITS. specially the receptionist  half bald fair completion cheater in specs  his lust for money is degrading hotel repo.  The staff including the receptionist is not willing to tell there names .. if so they will tell you anonymous names   Would give you the worst room if you book by oyo room quality is not even closest to the displayed   They would straight away ask to pay extra or see another one.   Waiters .. if you order a single bottel of water .. you cannot return it ...esle the waiters would abuse you and say  once ordered it cannot be returned appears like joke    but that happened. Receptionist the bluff master  as I tried to extend my stay for another day he took his handset marked the rooms as soled out and asked for double the amount if I want to stay      later started calling on my room s phone to vacate       I promised myself not enter   suggest that hotel to anyone even if its FREE. to management   if you really want to improve on business .. please approach me and take details.

' At first glance it looks like a very small place and in a not very great area surrounded by garages and the like. But step inside and all that changes. Hotel is small  but very neat. What it lacks in size it makes up in service and heart. Rooms are very neat comfortable....Ac works just fine... Bathrooms are also very nicely done. Rooms are too small for families though. Ideal for a single person traveling for a business trip. Don t know if they have larger rooms but families with one kid or more definitely need larger rooms. Food was good. Service was fast. The manager Mr. Altaf   if I remember right   was extremely helpful and pleasant. One advice about the location   when telling the auto guys better to tell them that this area is near Sion rather than kurla. Location for business travel is fantastic... Hardly 7 mins from Bandra Kurla complex. Where all the consulates are located. All in all amazing value for money  Nothing to complain at all    ',India

' We went for a family trip to Fort Unchagaon. This is a nice place which in middle of Village Unchagoan. The entrance is that of fort with walls and large gate which leads to an area for Parking and Horse Stable. There is a second gate which leads to the main building. The building was residence of Raja Surendra Pal Singh who renovated the fort even served as four time Congress MP from Bulandshahr and as a Minister of State for External Affairs. The fort came into the extended family s hands from British colonial rulers in the 1850s. The entire place is full of pictures and artifacts from the glorious days of the place when it must have been buzzing with activity. The rooms are nice and well furnished. The staff is very polite and courteous and more than willing to serve all  ',India

' The Good    This is a century old fort which has stood the test of time. To me it was more of a big mansion than a fort. It is a beautiful property with neatly done lawns and nice flower beds. The rooms are clean large and spacious but sadly look a bit dated and can do with a bit of makeover. The fort is full of artifacts that take you back to the royal era when Elephants Baggis and a classic Rolls Royce made part of a DAHEJ dowry . A room full of tiger heads overlooking anyone who entered suggesting the royalty had a penchant for hunting. They have a nice mix of outdoor and indoor games  Carom board Badminton and cricket of course  . You can also go for a bullock cart ride or try your hand at horse riding. There is a huge mango farm attached to the property. A stroll thru the huge mango farm is an elevating feeling. I would suggest that as a must do. The package is an all inclusive one so tea snacks and meals are available at specific times at earmarked places. The food not very fancy but good enough. In the morning you will be woken up with the soothing sound of old melody songs from a player placed in the front lawn. In the evening they have a bonfire and they have a nice local artist performing for good hour or two. Not to miss the staff is very hospitable. They are always there to help you out or escort you if required. The Bad    The last stretch of 20 km along the Ganga canal is not properly laid and is a fairly bumpy ride. Hopefully that will get fixed soon considering that other farms are also coming up in that area. The Ugly    This is almost a show spoiler. The last 500 meters leading to the fort is a village market full of all kind of hawkers and there is barely any space left to maneuver your vehicle. They are right up to the fort gate so much so that I missed the entrance on the first go.   ',India

' At this time of Pandemic we did take a chance to go for a weekend trip just before Diwali. We were looking for a pet friendly resort near Delhi and then we came across Fort Unchagaon at Garh Mukhteshwar. Needless to say we made the right choice. It was a wonderful stay at the fort. The best part of this fort is that it is very spacious  going by the fact that we had a labrador with us . While at the fort you do not have to think about going anywhere else. You can do all activities right from horse ride to bullock cart ride play indoor and outdoor games within the fort complex only. There is a swimming pool too. And even if you do not want to do anything you can simply relax on the sprawling green lawn. The fort has retained that traditional historical charm along with few modern improvisations. There are few rooms in the fort which are a kind of treasure house of old raja days prior to the British era. You will come across a room with over 15 tiger heads on the four walls staring down at everyone who walks in. These are supposed to be the real heads of tigers hunted by the king. This grand old zamindari haveli a resort in present time is owned by the family of a former king who inherited the fort in 1927 at the tender age of ten. A perfect weekend gateway you can say away from the hustle bustle of city life   a place for complete relaxation and good food. The only hitch there is a 20 km long stretch of a narrow road that leads to the fort in which you will experience some bumpy rides. And if you dont mind the bumpy ride you will definitely enjoy the treat that awaits you at the end of the journey. Lastly would definitely like to thank the co operative and friendly staff who were always at their best to provide us with the best service that we could ask for following all covid protocols.

' While most heritage hotels in Alwar district are born with the beauty and treasures of history not one offers such a spacious dream site. An impressive pillared building near the Entrance is the Hawa Mahal or palace of winds. This is used for dining and conferring under a gigantic lantern chandelier. The Rani Mahal on the north west corner of the property was the palace of the queens. It has amazing views on the countryside as well as the gardens. Twenty one lady painters designers and aesthetes have rooms and suites named after the. Their d cor is inspired and adorned by their works. The Mardana Mahal has large halls for seating and entertainment as well as a majestic garden court at its heart. Some of India s best known painters designers and creative people have created their magic in the rooms many of which are named after foreigners whose work here gave them an international reputation. Seven terraced gardens command a magnificent view above the tall ramparts. The gardens have been compared by guests to the Hanging Gardens of Babylonia   one of the seven wonders of the ancient world   and the ruins  now restored  to Machu Picchu. ',India
' This was a short trip to Tijara Fort Palace. One gets kind of jittery moving around in COVID times. However the property is professionally maintained by a courteous and hard working staff. The rooms were well sanitized. The staff follows the COVID sensitive protocols. The vantage point views at sunrise and sunset from the Vishakha Mahal  a room in Rani Mahal  were magical. Farms all around and Aravallis in the horizon added to the beauty of the place. The cuisine is authentic. Thanks you all at Tijara Fort Palace for making my stay a truely satisfying one. With normalcy returning I am looking forward to more such short trips to the place. ',India

' Wonder how I missed this place earlier.... Had a two day weekend trip to Tijara Fort Palace in Apr 21. Booking through official website was easy and helpful. Please note that the hotel has some 3 bedded rooms few  as well as 2 bedded rooms  majorly  and the rate is same in the category chosen. Complementary breakfast and high tea is part of the cost. Location is close to NCR and takes about 2 to 2 30 hours. Road is good except the last few kms in Tijara city and upto fort. Check in was super smooth and fast. Ayaan was extremely helpful and gave a commentary upgrade in room. Stayed in Vivek Mahal in Mardana Complex. Hotel is divided into Mardana complex   2 storied structure with max rooms  Rani Complex   4 storied structure with lift and second highest number of rooms  Deewar complex   few rooms with great sit out privacy and view  Tope mahal   only pet friendly single room  and Khajur complex   3 rooms ultimate privacy but 30 odd steps to reach  . All complexes within walking distance of Restaurant named Kaanch Mahal but gradient and steps abound as expected in any heritage resort. Decent restaurant with local flavour dishes hogging the limelight. Buffets and a la carte available. Hospitality and care beyond excellence special thanks to Sandeep and Pankaj. Meal choices are limited but preparation and quantity is good. Combo meal addition to the menu is a serious suggestion that I would like to make like other resorts are offering now a days. This is particularly useful for the Senior citizens or for people with low appetite. Saturday has a complementary cultural program by local artisans for an hour which is worth a watch. Swimming pool aptly called Pataal kund is great but was closed due to COVID. Has great sightseeing walking tracks sunset and sunrise points. Great photography options. Visit to all places within the complex requires atleast 2 days to savour and enjoy. R which is a must take event. Thanks to Ravindra for efforts taken and information shared during the tour. Ideal place for wedding and other family celebrations too. Will definitely re visit the place again.  ',India

' India urgently needs urban forests. What s stopping us from creating more  ',India
' Urban forests in India ',India
' During the virtual celebration of World Environment Day on June 5th this year Prakash Javadekar India s minister for environment forests and climate change launched the Nagar Van project. The scheme aims to create urban forest cover in 200 cities across the country in the next five years. ',India
' Oddly enough in 2016 Javadekar launched the exact same scheme at a commemorative function at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Borivali Mumbai. None of the experts The Third Pole s correspondent spoke to were aware of any progress on the scheme. Nor is any government data available on what goals were achieved on planting 200 city forests  between 2016 and 2020. ',India
' Despite the lack of progress there is no denying the benefits of urban forests and the critical role they play in augmenting city life. Trees help moderate temperatures in cities where heat radiated from concrete buildings and roads makes them warmer than the surrounding countryside in a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect. They also whittle down levels of ozone sulphur dioxide and particulate matter  remove large quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  and release oxygen. ',India
' Metropolises worldwide are thus increasingly creating urban forests. Seoul Singapore and Bangkok have built green corridors that provide space for nature and wildlife while improving the lives of city dwellers. Such initiatives are imperative given cities will host 68  of the world s population by 2050 according to the United Nations. ',India
' Urban green spaces under threat ',India
' Unfortunately right now in India even existing urban green spaces are under threat. In October 2019 Aarey Milk Colony in suburban Mumbai known as the city s  green lung  was caught in a raucous nationwide debate about ecology versus infrastructure projects. This was in response to a plan that involved Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation cutting down 3000 trees in the area to pave the way for a train depot. According to a scientific report the site is home to 86 species of butterflies 90 species of spiders 46 species of reptiles 34 species of wildflower and nine leopards. ',India
' Despite public outrage by the time the Supreme Court intervened the Maharashtra government and Mumbai Metro had cut down enough trees to clear the land required. ',India
' In the southern city of Bengaluru once known as India s greenest city the Bengaluru Development Authority has ravaged urban forests by building in them. The Turahalli forest in southern Bengaluru is being saved from garbage dumping and vandalism thanks to legal action initiated by the Environmental Support Group  ESG  a pan India advocacy forum. ESG has also teamed up with the Karnataka Forest Department to turn Turahalli into a space where bouldering climbing birdwatching natural history study trails can continue unimpeded without encroachments. ',India
' According to Chetan Agarwal senior fellow at NGO the Centre for Ecology Development and Research the biggest challenge in India is earmarking land for urban forests. There are competing claims on land from housing industry commercial areas that generate revenue as well as public infrastructure such as roads and water works. ',India
' There is little understanding or appreciation of the value of forests as green zones and as natural infrastructure that provides ecosystem services to city residents like clean air groundwater recharge flood control buffers wildlife habitat and natural recreational areas. Forest departments which have this understanding often have little clout in the town planning departments of states and cities and with the ministers that run these  cash cow  departments that ultimately drive the land use decisions in cities and towns  explained Agarwal. ',India
' Understanding city and forest planning ',India
' As for Javadekar s Nagar Van project Agarwal said there is a need to ask the 200 cities identified by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change  MoEFCC  to benchmark the current level of forests in and around the area   in acre terms and in per capita terms   and then ensure that they meet the minimum standards. He said the ministry should also plan to increase aggregate area and per capita area under forests in urban masterplans and land use plans. ',India
' The MoEFCC must mandate that city masterplans and regional plans undergo mandatory strategic environment assessments. This will help plan cities that conserve and enhance their limited environmental resources and make them more habitable he added. ',India
' Another strategy  suggested Agarwal is to identify common lands in villages near city boundaries and earmark them for forests so that by the time the city catches up with these areas they have already been reserved for forests.  ',India
' Some environmentalists suggest that policymakers need to look at environment zoning mandates used in regional plans in India. The Regional Plan for the Delhi National Capital Region  NCR  mandates a 10  forest area in the NCR and has a zoning category called a Natural Conservation Zone. The latter requires them to be protected and restricts construction in the Aravalli hills forests water bodies and riverbeds. ',India
' Political will ',India
' Unfortunately there seems to be a lack of political will. Leo Saldanha of ESG said Javadekar in particular has been known to make all sorts of promises and not deliver them. The Nagar Van plan is one more of such. To make urban forests a reality simply requires implementing the provisions of the Nagarpalika Act where ward committees can develop schemes to protect forests that are being urbanised and these plans are then integrated into the district metropolitan development plan and approved as such by the constitutionally empowered.  ',India
' According to Harini Nagendra professor of sustainability at Azim Premji University in Bengaluru what also needs to change is the mindset among foresters and official city planners that forests cannot co exist with cities. ',India
' The current lot of forest laws are restrictive conservative and territorial. We need to develop governance practices where urban forests are guided through local government instruments such as ward committees as envisaged in the Nagarpalika Act 1992  she explained. ',India
' Many good examples ',India
' One template that can be emulated Nagendra pointed out is the Warje urban forest in Pune. Maharashtra s first ever urban forestry project it was developed by TERRE a non profit with Tata Motors under a public private partnership model as a corporate social responsibility initiative. From a 16 hectare barren strip of land under the forest department encroached on by slums and builders Warje has been transformed into a thriving oasis of biodiversity. It hosts over 10000 indigenous plant species 29 local bird species 15 butterfly species 10 reptile species and three mammal species. ',India
' There are other good examples. Shimla hosts a sanctuary of around 1000 hectares that started off as the Shimla drinking water catchment forest managed by the municipal body in the 1890s. In south east Delhi the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary was remoulded from degraded village common land to reserve forest and then was ratified as a sanctuary. Delhi s Aravalli and Yamuna biodiversity parks have also successfully recreated the natural habitats and ecosystems of these regions in the city. ',India
' Similarly Gurgaon s Aravalli Biodiversity Park was created as a haven for native species in a degraded and mined landscape by a unique partnership between the municipal corporation civil society corporations and residents. It now has hundreds of flowering Aravalli trees and shrubs attracting almost 200 bird species. ',India
' Saldanha said that the problem may not be a lack of laws. The Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act 1961 suggests the creation of tree parks and such other unstructured wooded spaces but it has largely been used ritually and even violated substantially by not providing legally defined open and wooded spaces.  ',India
' Pradeep Tripathi founder of Green Yatra a group that promotes urban forests said that given the shortage of space and tight municipal budgets the idea of an urban forest itself needs to be redefined. A good and sustainable urban forestry model he explained is the Miyawaki method. Pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki it can be adapted with indigenous species for local conditions. ',India
' Miyawaki forests replicate a tropical rainforest where trees grow in layers with shorter shade loving trees in the undergrowth and high canopy species overhead. In conventional forestry around 1000 trees are grown in one acre. We plant 12000 in the same area under Miyawaki which creates the benefit of a 100 year old forest in 10 years  he elaborated. ',India
' Green Yatra planted 3000 saplings in a 10000 square foot area set aside for forest by the Central Railside Warehouse Company in Jogeshwari Mumbai earlier this year. Plans are now afoot to create two Miyawaki forests in Delhi after the pandemic. This dense forest will work like a carbon sink and groundwater recharge unit in time to come  said Tripathi. ',India
' Saldanha stressed that given the climate crisis it is vital to plan design and build green corridors in landlocked megacities like Delhi Bengaluru and Hyderabad while coastal cities must have strict regulations to protect beaches integrating them with the rest of the city s open and green spaces. ',India
' Similarly lakes and canals should be rehabilitated as urban ribbons of greenery. This will help reclaim concretised canals as green spaces increase natural cleansing of polluted water  done by plants and microflora fauna  while also recharging groundwater aquifers. ',India
' Such an approach will also create lakhs  hundreds of thousands  of new jobs. It won t cost builders owners civic and government agencies much to shape our cities this way   into living wonders  Saldanha concluded. ',India

' Jobs Of The Future For Students  The Last Part ',India
' Yes the world is divided into two types of people when it comes to the workforce. The first type who work  employees  and the second type who gives work  employers . If you are the first type it is essential that you get prepared to join the workforce with the necessary skills for the future. True the jobs have changed every decade. Nobody in the 1990s has envisioned of apps and e Commerce but it has occurred. And when it comes to safeguarding the employability you have to have the knowledge of how the existing roles can change and the type of jobs that will vanish in the trends of technology. ',India
' But there are many who are sceptical of the ways of working with robots in the near future. And the future jobs will get influenced by factors such as advances in technology increasing globalisation international laws rules and constant changes in consumer behaviour. It is these factors which will make rapid changes in future jobs. But now with your valuable permission shall we look into the jobs below   ',India
' 1. Locations ',India
' With the growth of population there may emerge a new set of jobs. However this job does not come to the future advancement of technology. If mankind has prepared a conducive infrastructure on other planets you may have to help relocate some of the population. ',India
' Or it could be the other way around. An earthquake or a natural calamity has struck at a place. There are lost lives and the entire infrastructure of the place is damaged. You provide the solace by helping the population shift to a normal place. Subjects you may have to study   human psychology world culture world geography seismology etc. ',India
' 2. Urban Agriculturalists ',India
' Are there fruits vegetables which are grown only in specific parts of the world  If yes then you create an artificial environment for the fruits vegetables to be grown in anyone s backyard or farm. This will be against Mother Nature but yes it is a challenge. You may have to study biology farming and environmental engineering. ',India
' 3. Service Providers For The Older Generation ',India
' With medical services at its best and various cures for all ailments in 2030 there will be a population of persons aged above 80. And this age requires special treatment in the form of separate food diet and goods. You may either become a service provider or work in an industrial manufacturing the goods. Study subjects may involve nursing psychology mechanical engineering and logistics. ',India
' 4. Transport Engineers ',India
' When the entire world has become global travel is not an option but becomes mandatory for CEOs and top level management professionals. But unlike these days there may emerge a set of new travel machines where it will be easy to travel individually between two adjoining countries easily at a speed of 500 km per hour. You may get a job in one of these companies as a reservation clerk or an engineer who manufactures these engine machines. ',India
' 5. Galactic Architect ',India
' Job  Deduce tracking of metals ',India
' The developed countries in space travel have already made preparations to reach asteroids and other objects by 2025. There is a chance to mine precious metals and have a landing station at Mars. Who knows  In the future humankind may build an infrastructure at Mars that can withstand temperatures to zero radiation. For this job you may have to study space architecture and maybe a Master s in Physics. ',India
' 6. Fusion Plants ',India
' International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor is built in France. The main objective is to fuse nuclei for yielding power. In the future its branches can spread to all corners of the world. You may get jobs in various capacities such as a physicist magnet officer or radiation officer. ',India
' 7. Undersea Welder ',India
' Welder even today work in oil fields to take care of infrastructure beneath the sea. Their job is to build and repair infrastructure pipelines and platforms. Search for new oil reserves is on the rise. For this job you may have to study architecture and welding. And yes you should have a certificate in scuba diving. ',India
' 8. Space Pilot ',India
' So we have aquatic SeaWorld in the land. Similarly the future is set for space travel. The price is no doubt expensive but with more companies joining the bandwagon in the future it could drop low. There can be other travel trips by companies for mining metals in asteroids and science. ',India
' 9. Wind Explorer ',India
' In the hot weather it is the cool breeze which lifts your spirits but when the wind comes to a typhoon or storm then it can cause mass destruction. With the growing demand for power efforts are on to find alternative sources of energy. So turbine energy windmills are increasing countryside in underdeveloped countries. You may get various job postings such as a wind engineering or logistics expert. You may have to study Wind Science Mechanical Engineering and yes physics. ',India
' 10. Zero Energy Home ',India
' For the past thousands of years humankind has made the maximum use of Mother Earth s resources. Now with oil levels and other natural resources on the path of depletion the effort is on to save the remaining assets. Also the focus is given on the building of new homes in such a way to conserve energy of any type be it the electrical energy or mechanical energy. That is the reason for LED type bulbs. The global population is on the way to build an eco friendly infrastructure. For this job you may have to study architecture and environmental management. ',India
' Who knows sooner or later you may use electronic appliances that can work entirely under sunlight  You have the solar cooker now you may also get a water purifier who works efficiently under sunlight. And a new set of jobs may emerge on the horizon. ',India
' Conclusion ',India
' So this completes the third part of jobs for the future for you dear students. In fact there are some more jobs to be discussed in the future weeks. Selfstudypoint has a small suggestion for students. If you are interested in the mechanical electrical industries keep a hawk s eye on the technology trend. The reason every manufacturer of brands in plumbing electronic items are going the digital line. Let us take for example a case study involving repair of water purifier and let us imagine you are in Bangalore. ',India
' Previously if the water purifier gets repaired if the warranty has completed its term you need to scout for referrals. Then in early 2000 you can search for them on listing websites. But since half a decade you need not do either of the two. Emerged a new set of companies which are providing top quality services at your doorstep. They have a qualified team of technicians who can give the best services for water purifier repair in Bangalore. All you have to do is to download the app of these companies and install in your mobile. You can then book a service as per your own convenience. The concerned technician will call you before the scheduled date to confirm the booking and nature of the repair. On the scheduled day he she will come and restore the appliance back to normal.

' Take a trip through the land of lake monsters and castles   the Scottish Highlands ',India
' When someone mentions Scotland I am transported to a time of lake monsters fairy tales glens and lochs and songs of love and lament by romantic poets   hence the Robert Burns inspired title. And I am not being in the least bit dramatic for driving through the mountains of the Scottish Highlands   the historic countryside of Scotland   is indeed truly exhilarating. All at once you can experience the forces of nature mingle with various seasons where sunshine intersperses with raindrops just as a beautiful rainbow unfolds. ',India
' The Highlands as they are commonly called are sparsely populated with little villages and towns dotting the mountain ranges and valleys. Yet there is much to enjoy in these serene surroundings  endless walks treks and cycle rides castles and fortresses to explore and traditional haggis and Scotch to enjoy. Plus a shot at learning the ancient language of Scottish Gaelic   still widely spoken among the locals. It s not so difficult when all the signboards are first in Gaelic and then in English  ',India
' My first stop was Ben Nevis   the highest mountain in the British Isles and a ski haven during winter. Although it was spring the tops of the mountain ranges were still covered in snow and the winds were ferocious. A cable car takes you to the top but if you are up for it then there s a dedicated walking and cycling path as well. If you crave some calorie shedding stamina building adventure then this is your hot ticket   it s not often that you can say you climbed Ben Nevis  ',India
' When in the Highlands you can t leave without seeing the glens   deep valleys usually with a watercourse running through it   and lochs  Scottish Gaelic term for  lake  . The Great Glen is a series of glens and a wonderful natural sight while a cruise on the Loch Ness is an adventure in itself. Loch Ness is Scotland s largest and deepest freshwater lake with breathtaking views all around  and is also infamous for the legend of the Loch Ness Monster called  Nessie  by the locals. ',India

' If you like to experiment with food the local Scottish delicacy haggis   a savoury pudding comprising parts of sheep s heart liver and lungs mixed with oats onion and spices   is a must try. It is an acquired taste and is traditionally served with a delicious whisky sauce. Wash it down with a traditional Scottish cream tea   scones with fresh clotted cream and jam with tea. ',India
' But the most famous export of the region of course is Scotch along with the Highland Single Malt and cousin Ale.

' This is perhaps one of India s best known  famous history  hotels. From pine green banquettes to Victorian four poster beds the d cor here is still reminiscent of the Raj. It is here that Jawaharlal Nehru Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Mountbatten would meet to discuss the Partition. An architect named FB Blomfield an associate of Sir Edwin Lutyens designed the property in 1934 and Lord Willingdon the then Viceroy and Governor General of India inaugurated it in 1936.

' One look at this property and it s easy to imagine what the golden age of luxury travel in India looked like.

' 2. Proposed new main office building for Surat Municipal Corporation ',India
' SMC s present head quarter building built in year 1644 is a heritage structure situated on a very narrow and busy road at Muglisara near Chowk Bazar which results in a very heavy traffic during office hours. Due to limited available working space in the existing building presently various important departments are situated at other places outside main office building. ',India
' SMC has decided to construct new high rise office building in the open plot of 22100 sq.mt. area at old district sub jail at Ring Road allotted by Government of Gujarat for the said purpose.

' 3. Surat Railway Station   Proposed Redevelopment   MMTH Project ',India
' Surat railway station is strategically located on one of the busiest railway routes connecting metro cities of New Delhi and Mumbai. It observes heavy passenger flows of around 2.5 Lacs passengers daily and hence becomes a critical point of interchange between different public transit modes. ',India
' Under the directions of Government of India through Ministry of Railways MOU has been signed on Dt.17 08 2016 among Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation  IRSDC  Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation Limited  GSRTC  and Surat Municipal Corporation  SMC . These three parties have jointly agreed to develop a Multi Modal Transportation Hub  MMTH  at Surat Railway Station Gujarat on DBFOT basis of PPP model. Project will be implemented through a joint venture Special Purpose Vehicle  SPV  with name of Surat Integrated Transportation Development Corporation Ltd  SITCO  incorporated under Companies Act on Dt.17 10 2017.

' Currently different options of project re structuring are being discussed among all 3 stakeholders to get the most competitive bid offers. Estimated Cost of mandatory part of MMTH project is Rs.895 Crores  excluding cost of commercial development which will be in developer s part . ',India
' 4. Conventional Barrage Project ',India
' Concept ',India
' Surat Municipal Corporation had constructed a low height weir across river Tapi at Singapore in the year 1995 30 km upstream of the confluence with the sea having storage capacity of about 31.01 MCM. The project was undertaken to supplement water supply to the Surat city as well as to various industries situated along the right bank of river Tapi in Hazira area. Due to impounding of the reservoir the SMC has constructed various water works at Sarthana Katargam and Jahangirpura. The reservoir has also caused continuous ground water recharging of Surat city area as well as reduction in salinity ingress. The top level of the weir is at El 6.00 m which is higher than the high tide level 5.5 m. The length of the weir is 580 m with ungated weir length 486.5 m and scouring sluice length 93.5 m. Crest width is 10 m and FRL at El 5.0 m. ',India
' Necessity of additional barrage ',India
' Ground water in Surat city area like Adajan Athwa lines Nanpura Piplod Bhata Umraetc have turned excessively brakish due to increase salinity ingress of sea water. Due to decrease in flow capacity of the river Tapi overflows occur frequently at Adajan Pal and Bhatha whenever flood peak exceeds 3.5 lakh cusec. The ground water level in this area varies from EL     7 m to EL    10 m and the maximum tide level near weir cum causeway is about EL 5.0 m. ',India
' Industrial effluent discharged by Hazira industrial area in estuarine part of river Tapi is carried up to weir cum causeway along with the sea tide. Similarly huge amount of industrial effluent discharged from Sachin GIDC in to river Mindhola also mingles with tidal flow in this estuarine part of river Tapi and the effluent brought up to Weir cum causeway and when the tide recedes it leaves behind filth and waste. ',India
' In Singanpore weir 16 automatic sluice gates have been provided to discharge excess water and maintain reservoir level up to EL  4.5 m. ',India
' During over flow of weir excess water from weir is wasted into sea in monsoon every year. In the years 2013 2014   2015 overflow was observed on the weir for 93 days 35 days and 10 days respectively. To utilize this water and create additional storage capacity of reservoir about 10 km downstream of weir cum causeway the SMC had proposed Conventional Barrage near  FRL 5.0 m  Piplod in addition to overcome the above stated problems.

' 5. Tapi Riverfront Development and Rejuvenation Project ',India
' Concept Note ',India
' Tapi is a perennial river which crosses over Surat city and serves to a population of approx. 6.5 millions in city. It is a life line of the city. It becomes very dynamic in nature at the end of its course when it meets with the Arabian Sea. It thus brings the saline tidal back flows in city during high  low tides all the way up to the Singanpore weir. It faces serious challenge of floods for which SMC has planned various flood embankment schemes along the river to accommodate rising levels of floods since 1976. Other issues are discharge of contaminated sewage from storm water outfalls water management after construction of Singanpore weir and development of slums at river banks which needs to be resolved. There have been many recreational facilities which have been developed on banks of river. Solutions of the issues and previous efforts of development need to be integrated in developing the project. The Tapi Riverfront Development and Rejuvenation Project is an initiative taken up by the Surat Municipal Corporation to develop the Tapi River  for approx. length of 33km from Kathore Bridge to ONGC Bridge  in a holistic and comprehensive manner and increase its asset value for Surat city.

' If you had to pick one of the two to visit and spend the night which would it be  It will be me and my 84 year old father  but he can still get around pretty well . We love historic places downtown areas with pubs stores restaurants. Love to be able to walk. Also love rivers and streams ',India
' Sadly despite still being a fine solid old town Huntly is not the place it was   moving its mart to Thainstone some years back meant its days as an area hub were over and beyond its supermarkets the town s facilities choices have been declining ever since although its proximity to some very fine Aberdeenshire countryside and historic places is superb. Not least it s very fine castle and some interesting archaeological sites that aren t on the tourist radar. ',India
' Inverurie however is very much on the up and has all the choices for places to stay drink eat and shop that you would likely want. The downside of its recent major expansion however is that it is now more of a dormitory town for Aberdeen than the distinctive country town it used to be. ',India
' That said it also has an excellent hinterland and some great river walks right on its doorstep   the Rivers Don and Urie run right through the town and as well as the stretch maintained as a public park the fishing paths are well worth an explore   esp west of the town where you pass into a valley lined with ancient trees fine old farms and houses and excellent bird life wildlife   a magical stretch of river and amongst the best salmon water in the area. Also in the town are an ancient ruined church with Pictish carved stones an early medieval motte hill and on the edge of town a good ancient stone circle. The new heritage centre also has much info exhibitions etc. ',India
' Then within a few minutes drive you are in the archaeological epicentre of Aberdeenshire and some very fine castles historic houses of different eras   notably Castle Fraser and the Fetternear Estate by nearby Kemnay which has been opened up for public access very well and has good traffic free walks and the ancient ruined Bishop s Palace. Also in Kemnay is the Point of Origin    a major piece of outdoor public art celebrating the heritage of Granite working in the area   with very fine views of the old quarry surrounding hills countryside. ',India
' It may not work given other travel commitments plans but have you thought about Ballater  Very lovely place. ',India
' Yes depending on how you are getting about Ballater might well be a better choice although the excellent river walk is somewhat limited FTM   some of the paths are still a bit roughly reconstructed after the Storm Frank damage and they only recently announced that funding had been secured to repair the last of the damaged footbridges. When it might actually happen is still anyone s guess though. ',India
' Similarly Elgin might also be a consideration   a very fine historic town with good choices and a lot in its hinterland or somewhere on Speyside   the Dufftown Craigellachie Aberlour area are all worth considering and the drive over the Cabrach Pass from Huntly Rhynie is excellent   and Auchindoun Castle is one of my favourites in that area. A superbly sited large ruin on an ancient hill fort in a magnificent location  plus hardly anyone goes there so you will probably have it to yourself  there is a decent car park up that track   ',India
' Inverurie is very handy for Bennachie where there are lovely forest trails suitable for a wide range of fitnesses. Bennachie itself is a hill with the remains of a vitrified fort on the top. It is a great viewpoint and a favourite hill for Aberdonians. Some details at https   forestryandland.gov.scot visit bennachie visitor centre ',India
' I d also recommend Elgin   a historic  but ruined  cathedral and  in non covid times  the shop and cafe of the wonderful Johnstons of Elgin cashmere and wooden clothing. ',India
' I have never been to Inverurie but we were in Huntly last autumn to visit the castle. I have to agree that Huntly itself was very down at heel and rather sad. However we just went there to look round the castle and I wouldn t have missed it for the world. It was very impressive  ',India
' Something else I was very impressed by was the exterior of the Castle Hotel which  strangely enough overlooks the castle. It looked absolutely beautiful  from the outside  so if you are only going for the night perhaps think about staying there maybe check reviews though with it being closed due to Covid restrictions none will be that up to date  With the castle and the hotel you will have a great deal of historical interest to keep you busy. ',India
' I haven t been to Huntly Castle in years woody but thanks got the reminder and I must pay a visit as soon as we can travel outside of the Highland Region. I need to go to Elgin soon  work related  so may have to do an extra detour     ',India
' I thought the Castle Hotel had closed some time before COVID   Did they find someone new to operate it   it was still up for sale in November  ',India
' I ve not been in it for years but played there several times in the past and yes it was a lovely place with a fair bit of history of its own. It as a seventeenth century house which as remodelled to become the seat of the Dukes of Gordon after the castle was put beyond use. ',India

' Hi I need to plan a week long trip to Mumbai and was thinking of going the first week of August. I recently read that this is during monsoon season but I am wondering how this would restrict my trip. ',India
' I am going on a scouting trip in order to plan a future trip for someone else. I will need to visit hotels restaurants and tourist sites. Will the heavy rain make it impossible to visit my proposed list of sites  Or will it just slow the progress down considerably  ',India
' I also have heard that I will not be able to take the boat to Elephanta Island during monsoon season. Is this correct  ',India
' Unfortunately I will be unable to go after August so visiting in the peak time of December is out of the question. I have to go between now and the end of August. ',India
' For the past three years during July August once there is heavy rainfall things come to a halt including Airports not being operated. And this can happen anytime between July August months depending on Monsoon. ',India
' the monsoon normally hits Mumbai around the 15th of June and lasts till the end of August. The peak period is normally between July 10th to August 10th. However this year the met office has predicted that the monsoon will arrive earlier by about a week to 10 days  not that they re known for getting anything right     ',India
' Hotels   Restaurants will all be open during the monsoon and you will not have any trouble getting to them apart from some slow moving traffic if there is heavy rain on that day. ',India
' Tourist sites are another matter altogether. Elephanta caves is accessible by boat and during the monsoons it is not advised to go there as the sea s are very rough and tides are high. The dhobi ghat which is another tourist attraction  washing   laundry colony  is not bustling with its usual energy. You also wont be able to get good photographs of tourist locations due to overcast skies. ',India
' In fact the only people to visit Mumbai in the monsoon with a touristy purpose are the arabs from the middle east because they havent seen rains    ',India
' I am from Florida so I am used to rain. I just want to make sure I can get as much done as I need to during my week long visit. I am disappointed however that I will not be able to go to Elephanta. ',India
' I may be able to go mid June. Despite the current predictions would that be a better time to go than early August  You mentioned the peak monsoon time is in July and August so I thought maybe it won t be so bad in June  ',India
' The monsoons are a bit flighty. It is normally expected to wind up by August but last couple of years it carried on till September   October. ',India
' Even though the monsoons start in June there are always spells in between when it doesnt rain for days and then it starts all over again. ',India
' Normally by the end of August it starts to wind down. Could you schedule your trip for end August instead of the first week  ',India
' All hotels and restaurants in Mumbai are open. This is India s commercial capital after all     ',India
' Some of the bazaar roads can get pretty mucky and miserable and the traffic could slow down during heavy downpours but otherwise I dont think you ll face any problems. In fact you may see a whole new side of Mumbai than is normally seen. ',India
' Mid June should be OK. I will call the boat services people find out for sure and let you know. ',India

' I would recommend mid June instead of August for a scouting trip. It is hot and humid as hell though even for someone from Florida    ',India
' I found this neat site that has great snippets on Mumbai I think it would be a perfect preparation for you if you are scouting for offering travel advisory services or tour services. They wrote to me recently asking if I wanted to host one of the snippets so thats how I found this site and I liked their offbeat interesting approach. http   www.geobeats.com  ',India
' How is the weather in the first week of July  How often are flights affected during this time  ',India
' Deepa I really like Geobeats.com. Great tip thanks. ',India
' When do the boats stop going to Elephanta  I m guessing there s probably not a specific date so a range would be okay. ',India
' When the rains come do they usually last a few hours or all day  In Florida we get regular afternoon thunderstorms that last only an hour or two. I m just trying to gauge how much this will affect the trip. I ll definitely try to go in June instead of August though and take my chances  ',India
' 32 helpful votes ',India
' Well the boats to Elephanta don t officially  close . There are people living on Elephanta you see  They need to get to mainland on a daily basis. What happens in the rains is that if the day is stormy then the storm signal goes up and on that day the boats won t go. The cave temple is open all through. Oh and also Elephanta is closed Mondays.

' Rains vary sometimes full day showers and sometimes just brief spells. ',India

' Best way to go to Aurangabad would be the flight as it is the fastest option. If you wish to go by bus or train then most of them are at night so that you have the day free for sight seeing. The train is the better option if you wish to see the countryside but better to take the night train so that you spend the daytime for sightseeing. Not much of a view in these parts so not much that you would miss out by taking the night train. You could take the train on the way back when it is in the daytime. Hope this helps. ',India

I drived a few weeks back from Mumbai to Aurangabad for work and was disappointed by the state of roads .. Train travel is fine but I feel the flight is the best way to go .. I personally don t like the trains mainly because they are unhygienic .. the stations are crowded and there is always a fear of stuff getting stolen .. ',India

It s a huge rambling building with original paintings art and furniture. The owner still lives there and we had the opportunity to meet him and his son. The food was surprizingly good although very slow  which is the Indian way  The rooms are absolutely huge water pressure is low but the beds are quite comfortable. ',India

' This is the place to immerse in history and forget the present time. The palace is very historic and partly crumbling and run down. Still very charming and with wonderful historical rooms. Furniture never restored very romantic setting for good dinners. There is no real reception desk so it is sometimes difficult to get a hold of service staff. No AC which can be problematic during hot nights. You should absolutely get a guide for the village there are a lot of amazing buildings you overlook easily  eg dozens of historic and grandiose wells some 500 years old  . No telefone of internet key stays outside the door cerating some security concerns although nothing happened. ',India

' This is an incredibly picturesque hotel   a dilapidated palace with lovely carvings hidden courtyards terraces and lattice work. Our room had coloured glass windows alcoves paintings pretty textiles. The welcome was very warm with helpful service and tasty  Indian  food. The rooms were clean. The view of the stars at night from the rooftop was simply spectacular. The trade off is that you do not get all the mod cons of a modern hotel  the room was chilly  it was december would be fine at another time of year  the bathroom was clean but we abandoned the shower in favour of pouring a bucket of water over ourselves  there was plenty of hot water  in the uninhabited rooms and courtyards there are lots of pigeons pigeon droppings and my friend saw a mouse... Usually I would opt for modern luxury but in this case I felt the trade off was worth making as the atmosphere was really very special and it was sufficiently comfortable for us to enjoy ourselves and get a good night s sleep.

' The Castle has seen better days but is still packed full of charm and nostalgia. We had three days there in a suite of rooms and had it not been for the unusually cold February nights would have been a brilliant experience. The castle is in the middle of the town. ',India
' There were tour parties there on two of our nights but they arrived after 5pm and were gone by 8 am. Other then that there was only one other pair of tourists for one night. Service was excellent the staff being efficient and friendly. Food was satisfactory taken in a lovely old restaurant or out on the courtyard in front of the restaurant. Relaxing just to sit in one of the many little corners and read in the sun. ',India
' Nearest railhead is Falna  Jodhpur to Mt Abu line  about 1 hour away by taxi  400R   hotel will arrange.  We visited Kumbhalgarh Fort one day which took 5 hours and cost 1000R. This was arranged by the hotal as was our journey to Udaipur via Ranakpur and the Jain temples when we left  1600R . ',India
' The hotel also arranged a guide for a village  1 1 2 hours  and countryside tour  3 hours  which cost 500R in total. The guide Babu was very friendly and knowledgeable. He is also an artist and offered us the chance to buy his paintings. ',India
' We could easily have spent a further night here pottering about the village and relaxing around the hotel. ',India

' Beautiful Nagar Castel. ',India
' Like the other reviews i agree its a beautiful place away from the madning crowd. The entire castel is made in wood the view is unmatched and it is not a busy place like kullu and manali but equally beautiful. ',India

' A perfect place for those looking to get away from the Mall Road culture of hill stations in India. Naggar Castle is around 22 kilometres from Manali and a quaint small town where you can still experience the old way of life of the mountain people. The rooms are large and cosy and the view from my room overlooking the Kullu valley was just awesome. ',India
' The food is good and the service is also quite nice. Overall a nice place to stay when in Manali. ',India

' Almost all Indian tourists are aware of Kullu and Manali in Himachal Pradesh. Kullu valley is the district headquarter of Kullu district and the start of the 40 kilometer climb to Manali. This is called the valley of the Gods and rightly so. This highway which is an international highway snakes besides the Beas river for the entire 40 kilometers as it climbs to Manali. However not many are aware of the alternate road between the two towns called the Left Bank Road since this runs on the left bank of the river. Though it is much narrower there is much less traffic on this road and it is infinitely more scenic than its right bank counterpart. Built by the army as a 12 month open road this runs high up in the mountains far beyond the reach of the treacherous Beas which wrecks havoc on the national highway during the monsoons. This road snakes through apple orchards and crosses a small town called Naggar which was once the capital of the King of Naggar. There is a castle of the king still standing called Naggar castle now being run as a hotel by the Himachal Tourism Development Corporation. There are very few rooms there but if you are lucky enough to get to stay the night there it is an experience worth remembering all your life. Even the stars appear closer and more brighter than in the plains  The entire palace is made of teak wood which is still in pristine condition. There is a small temple within the premises containing the deity worshiped by the then king. The food served at the restaurant is excellent more so since the clear air and high altitude really work up your apetite. The main downside is the lack of transport facilities. One has to have a private vehicle all the time since the local buses and very few and in very dilapidated condition. The service is also very erratic. All said and done the place does merit a visit.

' The Castle at Naggar  a wooden heritage castle  also hosts a heritage hotel run by HPTDC. The rooms are good though there is always so much more that can be done with any HPTDC property. During the day a steady stream of visitors crowds the castle and most of them also barge into the Residential area of the castle to click pictures and especially encroach onto the balcony of the Luxury Room  where we stayed since it offers nice views of the mountains from the first floor  to click pics. Even though sign boards ask castle visitors not to enter the residential area virtually everyone disregards them and the hotel or castle staff do little to enforce any order. Apart the food in the buffet is just about average. I d suggest ordering a la carte from the menu which is much better. Especially the grilled trout which was excellent.More ',India

' I liked Naggar because it took us away from the tourist crowd at Manali. Yet we could go to Rohtang Pass via a hired cab. ',India
' The hotel is a traditional princely property  and that is what is wow. However the lower floor rooms are not up to the mark. For meals we regularly headed out and found simple home cooked fare in nearby places. I d recommend burrowing down at a home stay rather than the Castle. That said the hotel and ambience may have changed  I am writing from memory. ',India
' It is worth seeing the property though and probably breakfasting from the common balcony that has seating outdoors. Great views of the snowy peaks make it worthwhile. ',India

' Great location   the majestic snow capped peaks and an uninterrupted view of the valley welcomes you at all times no wonder it s a natural choice of several film shoots. Rich heritage   it s a 16th century castle with a unique temple and a museum inside. Welcoming team   they acted more like hosts rather than staff from suggesting which rooms to reserve for a great view to taking care of all needs at all times including introducing a car driver cum guide who is actually a local apple orchard owner and impeccable tourist guide. Great food   the restaurant team is super not just skillwise but also heartwise   who else will bring a bowl of warm gulab jamuns to the room last thing at night even if you have forgotten to order it yourself. Try everything local and otherwise on the menu including grilled trouts and roast chicken. There are several negatives as well like creaking old furniture and rusted geysers and several things dated but I will choose to ignore them and compromise for a few days here. Must visit. Must stay.

' I had the misfortune to break my ankle on Christmas Day in India but my good fortune was that I was staying at the Darbargadh Palace. The whole Singh family immediately adopted me and looked after me for four days until my lousy insurance  Insureandgo   don t touch   finally got me into a hospital in Ahmedabad. Hanu himself drove me the nearly 200 k in his own car as he thought any other car would be to uncomfortable for me. After my op I went backwards and forwards between the hospital and Poshina and the kindness and care from the whole family and their staff made what could have been a very traumatic experience into one that was special and heartwarming.

The honey was the only delicious part of the meal  Even the tea was awful. The bathroom is huge the mirror is poorly lit and it could use a good cleaning as could the bedroom. The couch and chairs in the bedroom are in desperate need of reupholstering the furniture could use a good polishing. Lighting in bedroom was poor and it was impossible to read. Bed linens too small  Towels grey and old. Grounds could use a good gardener the paint job everywhere was sloppy and poorly done. There is no attention paid to detail here.

' At Lakshman Sagar old meets new in perfect harmony. The beautiful 19th Century Hunting Lodge of the Thakur of Raipur with the Zanana Woma s and Mardana Men s quarters has been lovingly restored with a touch of modern colours. These are now housing the dinning and lounge areas. The 900 sq. Meter  cottages  each with its own private pool are absolutely stunning. The height of luxury  All overlooking the large lake. My only negative about the cottages is that they only have water cooling and no air conditioning. The rooms are very hot and there is nowhere on the premises to get away from the heat as this also counts for the public areas. The food is beautifully presented all be it a bit bland unlike true Rajput cuisine. The service is outstanding. At this property one needs more than one day to really enjoy it. ',India

' Every thing is just perfect at this place... specially the staff. I was there for my birthday with friends. The resort manager Teji took extremely good care of us. The food is all home made out of fresh vegetables. The chef made a very unique and awesomely tasty cake on birthday night and we were surprised to know that it was made out of Lauki  bottle Ground  and milk. Another super experience was then Teji did complete blackout of resort lights as it was almost full moon night. The entire place was lit with moon light and the breeze was so pleasant on Janana Roof top. The only bad part was Cooling system in the rooms. The rooms were hot and humid to sleep. and as its in middle of forest expect to have all types of insects and reptiles in your room and in open areas. But still the experience of this place would let you forget about these things. ',India

' Greetings From Lakshman Sagar   ',India
' Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. We appreciate all the kind words you have for Lakshman Sagar based on your experience and stay with us. ',India
' At the same time we wanted to apologise about the issue with the rooms not optimally cooling during your stay. While we do have the heavy duty desert coolers since we opened for the first year during monsoons and earlier than October when we usually do we unfortunately didn t manage to get the temperature setting to optimal levels and we are sorry you had to be one of the guests who had to face such a discomfort during your stay. ',India
' Similarly for the insects due to the monsoon opening we experienced a real onslaught during the initial weeks and while we believed it would have subsided by the dates you were staying with us I think the natural methods we tried incorporating to minimise the same didn t work out as well as we had anticipated.

' Its been a great learning experience for us to open earlier this year albeit with teething issues you pointed out and we can promise you that we are constantly making amends to all such irritants all within our core driving philosophies   values while operating a lodge property in a rural setting touching the buffer of a wildlife sanctuary.

' A luxurious nature retreat in the heart of stunning wild Rajasthani countryside. If you love to be close to nature this place is unbeatable. An old Maharaja s hunting lodge lovingly preserved and the area added to with private secluded rooms which are actually mini houses made of mud but with every modern amenity taken care of all in keeping with the surrounding environment. This resort features a stunning lake myriads of birds dining under the stars  on some nights you can even see the milky way   private plunge pools outside every room   in short it was nothing short of spectacular. The staff couldn t have been more helpful or charming  from catering to my difficult food requirements to making custom made spa treatments for sun burn organising fishing trips and forest walks. The rooms are beautiful the beds are huge and so comfortable and the amazing rain shower is a luxurious adventure in itself  Can t recommend this place highly enough. ',India

It is also very central and close to towns of Mandu Maheshwar and Omkareshwar so one can make it a base and have day trips to all these towns which have very few accommodation options . 2. Service  Very polite and warm service starting with Kamna who is such an asset to the place and such a pleasant hospitable host. 3.

However we discussed the issue with the management and they promised to look into it and make sure it never happened again. This place is also not for people who like the hustle and bustle of Malls or TVs or general touristy things on vacation. It is for people who enjoy nature beauty and a quiet peaceful vacation.

' A wonderful heritage hotel in the midst of fields Jhira Bagh was everything that you would want in a place to stay for a quiet time away from the noise and bustle of a big city like Indore. The room was spacious with a sitting area the bedroom with comfortable old four poster beds antique looking fans and studio portraits on the walls. The art deco style hotel is wonderfully restored and a jewel in the countryside. Kamana who is in charge of the propertywas ever so helpful with ideas and planning our visit to Bagh Mandu and Maheshwar. From the time we made our booking to our departure to Indore she made sure that we were well looked after. The food was like eating at home and care was taken to give us a really varied menu with seasonal fruits and vegetables. Thank you Mr. Baghel for your kind service. And last but not least a big thank you to Mr. Suryavanshi the owner who made the palace come alive with so many illuminating stories about the history of Jhira Bagh Palace and the many interesting people who visited the place.

I have fallen in love with this place deeply truly madly. This is not a place to seek creature comforts but to admire the silence it exudes so loudly.

' A Palace not a Hotel ',India
' The title of this review is what the owner of Jhira Bagh said to us when we referred to the place as a hotel. This is a quiet palace in the midst of acres and acres of farmland more like a retreat and a far cry from the opulence and grandeur that one associates with the palace hotels of Rajasthan. In that lies the uniqueness of the place within the vastness there is a sense of quietness and tranquillity that are generally not part of hotels. The small staff is most eager to please but at the same time not obtrusive. The food though a fixed menu  has enough variety in fact they even ask you what you wish to eat then pamper you. The palace complex includes a dairy farm and a vegetable fruit and rice growing fields. You food therefore is wholesome and organic. This is an ideal place to stay to access the breathtaking monuments of Mandu just 30kms away. The best time of the year for both the palace as well as the monuments is during the monsoons. The lush green surrounding the palace will add to your sense of peace. There are not too many rooms here so book well in advance.More ',India

' Jhira Bagh Palace got 4 stars and not 3 because it couldnot be less strategically positioned. Quite far from Mandu as the only major attraction in near vicinity and also away from Udaipur   Indore or even Indore Mumbai roads. For this reason I believe it is seldom crowded. This brings some advantages and some disadvanatges. Historical building is well perserved though a bit dull. On the other side they have well stocked museum with plenty of artefacts from prehistorical to recent ones. Rooms are decent though not obewhelming. Despite we were sole guests that night we got well prepared dinner and surprisongly also extensive and delicious breakfast. One could see that service lacks more guests but all in all we have no complaints. ',India

' This Konyak village in Nagaland is right on Indo Myanmar border. It is a different feeling just to be there. ',India
' Not everybody can be there at Longwa village which is at the border of India and Myanmar. Reasons  for non Naga Indians you need an inner line permit to enter Nagaland. And roads in Nagaland are pathetic. This village is in Mon district and the district headquarter is just 49 kilometres and it takes more than three hours one way. And from Jorhat it may take more than 12 hours running if you survive the journey which is very difficult. If you manage all this than entire Nagaland is beautiful. It is like this  nature has been generous with north eastern hill states lush green hills fabulous rivers waterfalls breathtaking scenery but manmade things like infrastructure like roads places of stay leaves much to be desired. I was lucky to be there and it is a breathtaking view from top of the ridge of Longwa village where all around is green view of hills trees and valleys.You stand on the top of the ridge view is same  beautiful. But then come human interventions. If you look at one side it is India. On the other the entire view is of Myanmar. And for the local Konyak villager who has been here for hundreds of years it is same tribe on the both the sides of the border. Distinctions are artificial. One can see the border pillar which is the only thing which shows where India ends and where Myanmar begins Just the lone border pillar. If you love travel amid nature and can take a difficult journey it is good to be there. Yes the chiefs house is half in India half in Myanmar. ',India

' Nagaland s Longwa village consisting of mostly Konyak tribe is located at India Myanmar boarder about 42 kms from Mon town which can be covered within 2 hours through a very bad road. However once you reach there the surrounding of the village and natural beauties thrill you for sure. Konakas are famous for their valor and were practicing headhunting in earlier days. The village Chief King who represents the tribe is just 32 years old and already has two wives. He became Chief only very recently after the death of his father who had several wives. He governs about 40 villages located in Myanmar and 17 20 villages in India. He has a cabinet consisting of several headhunters. His earlier palace made of hatched roof was destroyed due to storm. A new concrete Palace is being constructed whose half living room is in India and half in Myanmar. You can arrange a home stay there or make a day trip from Mon. However in order to visit the whole village in its entirety you need a reliable guide who is known to the Chief and local population. We spent the whole day there and enjoyed our time with a local tribal family trying all their local food in the midst of their wholehearted hospitality. Also we had a long session with the King and his cabinet and participated tested their opium smoking ceremony   took a photograph with the King   Charges  Rs. 200.00 as entry fee to the village.

' We stayed in the village in an apparently purpose built block for tourists whcih bizarrely says it s a legal centre on the outside. It s right next to the King s House on the border with Myanmar. It s very poor accommodation and our guides had to set up everything from the beds plus bring plates food the lot. Just camping really. ',India
' I found the village quite difficult culturally. It s a bit of a circus around the Kings House and although the kids are sweet the general atmosphere is not very welcoming less so as you walk away from this area. The Nagas have a complicated history of inter tribal feuds and difficulties with occupying forces and today seek independence from India.  By contrast I found the feeling in Tuophene village much more relaxed and welcoming . It s a long drive to Longwe and I would question whether it s worthwhile if you re just dipping in and out ',India

' Long ride from Mon half way is bad the other half good. Scattered houses in the hill and the greenish flora between Nagaland and Burma with an open border very small scale trade  the larger share you wont see i guess  people are still not used to tourism which starts growing  however small in numbers . You feel that this is not an easy stretch on earth. If you manage to meet pwople  at home  you see amazing things and people senior retired headhunters included young wild looking chaps with guns and riding the motorbikes on steep paths with very strange perfection. Artefacts available and there is a danger of a hectic  sale  after which not much will be left if not kept in mind of a local museum... Good reed roffed houses very basic partially big the chiefs house is immensly big. Beautiful woodcarving in the Morung the boys house... Spend time ther. But get yourself someone trustworthy with a good radiance to the locals. Indeed  The Konyaks are still very different... ',India

Traditional huts and tattooed villagers can be still seen. Headhunting was practiced earlier by the Konyak people. It can be covered on a day trip from Mon town.

This is my third time staying at the hotel with a small group and I will be happy to so again in the future. ',India

' Umaid Lake Palace..What can we say  A regal palatial estate tucked far away in the countryside close to the Chand Baori Stepwell Abhaneri in Rajasthan. We enjoyed every moment in this quiet family run hideaway with exemplary personal service at every turn. The team arranged unique experiences for our family that cannot be duplicated anywhere else in the world and we were so thankful.

' The whole staff are senior citizens and extra rude zero hospitality. Room service number is always busy and no help there. No cleanliness as you can see in the pictures. It s a heritage property not well maintained. Spider webs are all around. We had a package for couple of nights but with these conditions I checked out the next day and the major reason is the rudeness and the improper staff behaviour. The staff is in some other impression and not understanding the value or meaning of guests and hospitality they should understand that we are paying handsome amount for the stay and they are not doing charity on us. I have been to many resorts but this was worst and spoiled my weekend  even a OYO is better then this. ',India

' A TRULY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE YOU WILL NEVER FORGET ',India
' A REMARKABLE ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE. Flying with the Birds with Christian Moullec in his ultralight flying machine was nothing less than a dream come true experience to be enjoyed by young and old alike. I happened to see a video online and immediately knew I wanted to do it    I traveled from New York City for the experience. You fly in complete freedom in formation with the birds   you can touch them when they pass and look them in the eye . Christian Moullec  an ornithologist who rescues birds  and his staff are extremely nice. You should definitely pay extra and get the video of your flight. ',India
' My Paris friend and I stayed in Saint Flour which is very close and convenient   just 10  minute drive for the early morning flight  which is where they recommend staying . Follow their advice for dressing warmly  I suggest staying 2 nights in case your flight has to be rescheduled due to rain weather conditions. My flight went as planned but the region gets a lot of rain so it is possible. ',India
' The L Auvergne region in central France is very pretty and should be explored when you are there. We stayed in the area for 9 days to explore and also hike the inactive volcanoes. But even 3 days would be nice. If you are going to explore I wouldn t suggest staying in Saint Flour because there are prettier towns and tiny villages which have very inexpensive and nice gites to stay at  such as Anglards de Salers Heume l Eglise and others .

' This was one of the best decisions I ever made. I will never forget the day. Even though there was no simple way to get to St. Flour I would fly again in a heartbeat. You can take a train to Clermont Ferrand from Paris and then taxi or rent a car from Clermont to go the rest of the way or rent a car from Paris if you are going to return to Paris after your stay. It took about 5 6 hours to drive from Paris to St Flour. Most of the drive is major highway but you will end up be in the middle of the country. My son used his phone GPS and that is what got us there. We would have been lost without it literally. ',India
' We stayed at Les Fontilles in Le Bourg which is very close to St Flour and the small airport where you will fly with the birds.  Voler Avec les Oiseaux . There were only 2 small places to stay in Le Bourg. You could stay in St Flour which is a larger town but St Bourg is just a bit closer given the fact you must get to the airport very early in the morning  ',India
' We arrived at the aerodrome got our instructions and then watched the birds while they were in their pens awaiting their flight with us. Only two flights go a day so as not to tire the birds and the flights are early in the morning when it is cooler. I got a helmet and a microphone to communicate with the pilot. Next I was strapped in and away I went.. The initial ascent took my breath away but that was short lived. I was flying 5 thousand feet in the air in formation with a flock of geese. They were so close I could touch them. I watched them taking breaths during flight and was amazed at how aerodynamic they were. I felt exhilaration and a sense of peace and freedom. The views were amazing. The countryside was so green and beautiful. One of the sights was a castle and a waterfall. ',India
' We were up for about 30 minutes. You cannot take pictures while you are flying but they have a camera on one of the wings and they will send you the video for a fee. The video comes out great and you can take still photos from the video. ',India
' Four people in our group flew over a span of two days. All four were very happy campers for days after. It is a memory I will cherish the rest of my life. ',India

However I am so glad I travelled all the way to this beautiful town in Cantal  Coltines and Saint Flour  and met Mr Moullec for this memorable flight with the birds.

' Morning painted the Evergreen Estate in bright colours. Mostly green. But there were some other colours on display as well. The light pink of freshly dropped flowers a yellow pineapple being sliced for breakfast a chocolate brown calf the Heliconia yellows and the slate velvet grey of the 2 hounds running around the dew soaked lawn. My son  borrowed  George s son s red cycle and squeaked around. The wife was busy shooting a portfolio of her latest jewellery designs against the backdrop of a verdant forest. I longed for breakfast. ',India
' Breakfast was star shaped appams an egg stew toast home made jams and pineapple juice. I kept an eye out for the pineapple dessert from last night but it was not to be. Ah well. Mom got tips on the making of a star shaped appam post which I quickly rounded up 3 of the 4 Abrahams got some pictures with them and their lovely house and headed out to our next destination.

' I was already aware that the owner Mr George Abraham was away at a family wedding but was assured via him via Mahindra Homestays that I would be well looked after by his Boy or Baby    .  Baby  turned out to be the lovely Mr Baby who welcomed and looked after me superbly. As the only person staying at the bungalow it was a little like having a personal butler for an evening. ',India
' The Homestay is superbly located  it s a little out of Kootickal which is a quiet place anyway so there s no sound but insects. The Bungalow looks up to the mountains and the jungle. It s a lovely 1950s building quirky architecture lots of unusual features. The veranda provides a perfect spot to relax. Although it wasn t expected  as I arrived earlier than planned  Mr Baby served up a lovely afternoon pot of tea with some banana fritters and a toasted spiced egg sandwich. ',India
' Unfortunately the weather wasn t on my side and there was a sudden and spectacular thunder storm and deluge which put paid to exploring the locality. However there is much local walking and exploring to be done. ',India
' Mr George Abraham phoned in the afternoon to check that I was OK to apologise for not being there in person and to warn me that there was a day of strike action the next day which would see all shops and stalls shut and little for me to eat on route. Concerned he offered me the room for a second night free of charge to avoid the inconvenience. I was quite dumbstruck. ',India
' The evening meal was served in the dining room at the elegant horseshoe table. A beautiful Muttar panneer paratha salad and lentil cakes   perfect quantities and absolutely delicious. ',India
' Afterwards retire to my spacious and quite grand room  no air con but the fan provided enough cool air. The bathroom is very nice   more modern than the rest of the room. ',India
' Evergreen Estate Bungalow managed to do something very special  it made me very welcome and was utterly personal service. I felt much more than a guest and was treated with a level of courtesy and attention that never stepped over in to fawning. Any other hotel I stay at will have to work very hard to make me feel this much of a valued guest. ',India
' When I return to Kerala which I will do at some point I ll stay here for a week. There s more than enough to do in the surrounding area and I want to enjoy this level of hospitality in this beautiful environment again. Utterly unique and enchanting. ',India

' I stayed with George and Anju in September as part of a longer homestay trip around southern India. Their house is set in a wonderful location in the middle of a rubber plantation. The couple are extremely hospitable and are happy for you to be integrated into their family life but also give you time and space to relax on your own and enjoy your surroundings. George gave me a very interesting guided tour of the plantation and the surrounding area. He has written a book about the history of Mundakayam and is very knowledgeable about colonial times. The food here is also a particular highlight   appams light vegetable curries fish molly. You certainly won t starve  ',India

' This hotel is far from Udaipur. It took us good 90 mins to reach the hotel. This hotel is located between the wilderness of the Aravali. The location is beautiful. Cell phone signals are a problem. I must compliment the staff management and the owners of the property for a job well done. From room interiors to going the extra mile by the staff for service ambience or the quality of food we absolutely got our penny s worth. The swimming pool was clean too. It is a newly renovated property with excellent rooms and clean restrooms. This is a perfect place to escape the hustle bustle of everyday life. ',India

' Loved our 3 nights stay in this Palace...was an experience i would rather say...besides the local tour you can spend 1 whole day in the hotel and relax in the amazing hill viewing pool. Was lucky to have been there when the weather was awesome cloudy and a little rain. best place to kick your office burden   Only negative point is that being a 4 star hotel the meal cost are a little on the higher side but you can always manage eating out and coming back to the hotel.

' We spent just one night here while coming back from Nathdwara. I was quite keen on the hotel as it a new one and usually we go to udaipur once in 3 months so i wanted to try this new property. I would say my booking process was quite smooth since i had spoken and confirmed my booking directly with Mr. Udai Singhji who is the owner. But than once the booking got confirmed we had a night mare specially searching the place. The place on google maps is pointed incorrect and is on the other side of the highway and since there is no network availability around that area it was jus 45 min. of madness in the heat. The hoardings are placed soo incorrectly that one cannot see it on the main highway. Next once we reached the hotel the checking was smooth but no mini refrigerator in the rooms which by request they kept our stuff in their main refrigeration. The place is still building up and totally short of staff. We had mentioned that the Swimming Pool need to be cleaned before about 1.5 hours but they only started cleaning once I had to scream on them. The food is quite good but as of now they do not have menus printed or any other details and the hotel is open since Dec. 2015. I mean what hotel do not have menu printed not in restaurant nor in rooms. The Internet had some issues so there were no network n data to contact ppl back home. Rooms   Bathrooms were huge   comfortable. Also Hot Water was available in some rooms n not in some  we know as we had booked 2 rooms . Food the taste was pretty good but not up to a 4 or 5 star hotel breakfast or dinner. They need to improvise quite a lot as there is lot of competition around. Bar not yet started or half way under construction. I think they haven t got their license and still they are not approved with any star. I would definitely not recommend this hotel for atleast 2 years. ',India

' Dear Guest Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write this feedback on TripAdvisor. I am glad that you shared your experience and informed us about how we can improve our services. I apologize for the inconvenience and trouble you had while staying at the property. I would like to clarify you that we have improved our google location on google map and now none of our guests are facing location issues. The problem was occurred when we opened the property for bookings and the exact location was not marked. The day you arrived was the day when all our rooms were sold out and unfortunately the refrigerator in your room was technically faulted. Further I would like to share with you that network connections are now perfect inside the property and full speed wifi is also there for free. I would request you to kindly come once again and see the improvements. I hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve you and restore your faith in us. I look forward to hosting you again.

If you are planning to stay there then just be prepared for an unpleasant stay at the hotel  The manager of the hotel Mr Amar Singh was the only person in the hotel who knew how to deal with the guests otherwise every other staff or even the higher management did not had a clue how to work in a hospitality industry    Not worth the money     ',India

Try for morning bird watching which resorts itself arranges for it. It s great. Visit to their another resort pangarh can be done. There they have done good farming which can be looked upon.

' I can t wait to return and undertake the 8 day horse riding trek  ',India
' It seems a love of horses is something I share with the Royal Family here as early in my stay I purchased a small horse head souvenir usually made for the Indian cavalry. These wonderful Mawali horses with ears that point inwards had intrigued me from the time I arrived in India and the charming Hotel Castle Bijaipur offered horse riding to its guests. Soon after my purchase the princess tracked me down invited me to join her for a drink and enlightened me as to her husband s commitment to all things equestrian and the Mawali breed  ',India
' The princess and her little boy and later the prince himself made me feel utterly at home and welcome. ',India
' Despite the fact I grew up on the back of a horse it had been many years since I had been in the saddle. I requested a quiet bomb proof horse and was not disappointed. ',India
' The gentle skewbald Mawali mare I was presented to ride was sure of foot and sound of body and temperament. She was quiet enough to not blink an eye let alone shy when we had to pass a group of workmen welding on a building site en route through the village to the countryside then upon return an electrical fault was sparking out from fallen wires near the palace entrance. My own horses would have reacted to such unique disturbances to the normal but my dear Mawali steed was rock steady  Views from the high point of the ride were sublime and my mounts gait was loping and comfortable. Her extended walk on a long rein was fantastic and by the end of my ridemy muscle memory had kicked in and confidence regained. I easily negotiated some steep and slippery descents. I was not even stiff and sore later but I did take it very easy  ',India
' Tack was in excellent condition and my Indian cavalry saddle was really comfortable. The grooms and stable hands were obliging and delightful and gentle and caring with their animals the mounting block appreciated. Even more unexpected was to be greeted by the prince upon my return along with his lovely Great Dane two greyhounds and a pointer. ',India
' My room was spacious furnished with antiques excellent aircon appreciated in the 40 degree heat and overlooked a fabulous courtyard. ',India
' I also enjoyed interactions with the grounds staff as I explored their kitchen gardens edible plantings and practices in their cultivation. ',India
' The local village of Bijaipur was welcoming and unspoiled by tourism. We were made welcome at the local temple and the women drawing water at the well and many of the shopkeepers welcomed interaction. ',India
' Here too the profits from the hotel are being put to good work with ever expanding access to quality education within the village. ',India
' Food was excellent and the bar well stocked with spirits and the best of Indian wine. ',India
' I highly recommend an extended stay at the delightful Hotel Castle Bijaipur. It was a genuine privilege to be so warmly received by its Royal family and the broader community an enriching experience which opens the traditions and culture of Rajasthan in a manner that transcends the limited experience that is gained in big cities and at the big draw card historical sites. Don t miss this unique experience and exceptional hospitality  Horse lovers and equestrians should plan an extended stay here  ',India

In terms of amenities     low quality of food service not upto scratch hot water for bathing has to be repeatedly requested  the automatic hot water facility just does not seem to work .

As a 2 star establishment it really shows up accommodation of higher ratings. The room is spotlessly clean the bathroom small but modern with all the amenities you could want. Breakfast was simple but freshly prepared and tasty. Location is in a quiet residential area but close enough to the metro station and a huge market  shopping area.

Enjoyed the stay as did not face any problems due to air conditioning or bed bugs. The only flip side is their breakfast is not elaborate   do not have any wide spread for BF.

There used to be a false fire alarm ringing randomly at midnights around 2AM 3AM and create a panicking situation and there was nobody answerable for this.

The positive is  the staff are really kind and quite hospitable and the location is also okay.. But all other aspects were very unsatisfactory.. The room is cramped... The bed chairs doors commode everything give a very old look..electric sockets boards were not closed. Could feel the smell of dampness in the room and there was no proper ventilation also. It took quite a long time for me to doze off even after a long tiring day.. But as I said in the beginning its a cheap hotel and thats all we can expect. ',India

' Do not waste your time by coming here. They didn t have WiFi TV was out of order Lift didn t open in 2nd Floor. Breakfast took ages to be prepared. And they tried to justify that by saying that Since we ordered 4 breakfast together it will take time when 20 min was listed in their menu. Mosquitoes Leaky Washroom No Toiletries or towel until you ask. A total rubbish. Stay away from this place. Just stay away ',India

' It is very rare these days to find a big natural lake where you can walk around or just sit and enjoy the peace. Lingabudi Lake still has the old time charm of a lovely calm lake. One can walk around in the walking path sighting migratory and resident birds. There are a number of varieties of birds that you can spot. Or one can just sit on the benches or by the lakeside and relax. ',India

' Mysore city in Karnataka India is popular among tourists throughout the web. It has several titles to its credit like  Beautiful city   City of palaces  City of Museums   City of Temples  and  City of Gardens . According to me it is also a  City of beautiful Lakes  attracting birds and butterflies  from many corners of the world. The most famous are K R Sagar and Brindavan. These are the items that made Mysore to be on the map of international tourists  dots in India. The Mysore Palace is the official Royal residence known as  Ambavilas palace  which is the most visited place in India thrashing the historical places such as Red Fort Qutbminar and Taj Mahal. According to New York Times Mysore is at 31st place in  must see places  on Globe. A lake can be defined as  a large body of water  surrounded by land inhabited by various aquatic life forms. They are subjected to variety of natural development bearing on environment like the hydrologic cycle. We have been witnesseing an unprecedented development on saving waste water recycling it and related activities of utilizing Storm water runoff and discharge of sewage into the lakes. We can say that humans are cause for choking several lakes to death. But in Mysore all such lakes are brought to life as attractive fountains gardens and bird sanctuaries. One such out of more than a dozes is Lingambudhi Lake. Mysore has many lakes and ponds inside and outside the city. Most popular and well maintained lakes can be named as Kukkarahalli Lake Lingabudi Lake and Karanji Lake. These lakes are frequented by tourists and mostly by residents of Mysore to spend their cool and nice evening enjoying the breez on these tank beds while some will have fun over a weekend. These lakes are an integral part of Mysore city. Lingabudi Kere  Lake  with an attached beautiful park by its side is found in Sriramapura locality in Mysore city. It has been attracting varieties of migratory birds. This area is completely of green which made it an attraction for nature lovers. It is popularly called as Lingambudi Lake. It is one of the largest and oldest lakes in Mysore. We can watch vast variety of birds like Spoonbill White Ibis Kingfisher Little Cormorant River Tern Open Bill Stork and many more near this Lake. It is said that in every year more than 250 species of migratory birds have been visiting this spot. The beautiful array of marigold rose hibiscus and many flowering plants make the visitors feel refreshed and fill in new enthusiasm to enjoy the beautiful environment prevailing here as experienced by me. This lake is really a favorite spot for nature lovers to freshen their mind and strain by relaxing here. This waterbody has occupied more than 3 acres of land. It is fenced probably to guard from encroachers along the periphery. The walkway adjoining the lake provides an opening for visitors to enjoy walking amidst nature as well enjoying its loveliness. I sat on a stone bench provided there for the convenience of visitors for a while admiring the charming sight of the scenery. I could see that it is not so well maintained compared to other Lakes that I have visited in this city. This is a suitable place to enjoy some solitude bliss in Mysore. The recrd says that this lake is qualified as bio  diversity lake that allows visitors to enjoy walking on sidewalks between 6 am to 6pm. It is about 8Km from city. Many buses are available from city bus stand. Autos are available from every area of the city. ',India

' It was a while since we were on a holiday and this seemed to be a good pick after seeing the reviews on trip advisor. It was we as a couple and in laws who were senior citizens hence had to ensure everything was just perfect. Thanks to all the fellow mates on trip advisor for posting reviews and answering my questions as well. We finally made it and no regrets at all. Everything right from the start until we made it back was smooth with no hiccups. Thanks to Vijay who helped us in the booking. Mr. Sujoy dutta who maintains the place was so courteous and helped us with all our requests. Inder God knows how he keeps smiling all the time people like him are required more in the hospitality industry. Fort restored as a resort maintains the haveli charm as someone rightly said. Still untouched by commercialization we were the only family who checked in on Apr 17. Huge property  well maintained hats off to the chef what sumptuous meal was prepared every time. Lovely rooms a bit of dusting required though but that shouldn t stop you from holidaying there. The weather was conducive and we couldn t ask for more. A 3 hour drive from Delhi it was such a relief to have this break with no TV net connectivity  systems were down due to storm . Life was different away from connectivity.

' If you are fascinated by history and want to taste the old world charm  this is the place for you. We went there with family friends on my birthday and we all returned with smiling faces and a promise to return. The Fort is located in a small town amidst mango orchards and fields. There are sprawling garderns in forefront with swings and hammocks and the kids just love it. The rooms are huge with antique furniture. There are so many sit out areas where you can spend hours listening to the birds chirping or just admiring the beauty of the place. The food was great and the hospitality was excellent. They make you feel like royalty. They listen to your demands patiently and i never heard them saying  no  for anything. The pool is in the middle of the mango orchards and faces a cricket field. They filled the pool with fresh water especially for us and the kids loved it. We had to drag them out...it was quite cute  Also they have a stable and horses and they provide rides bullock cart ride tractor ride and they also arrange for a short day trip to Garhmukteshwar for spotting Ganga dolphins. To give you a gist this place is just a 3 hours drive from Delhi and best for an outing with family or friends and kids enjoy the place as much. We would love to go again. This is a place where time takes a halt. Thank you team Unchagaon for making this staycation worthwhile and memorable    ',India

' We went for a family trip to Fort Unchagaon. This is a nice place which in middle of Village Unchagoan. The entrance is that of fort with walls and large gate which leads to an area for Parking and Horse Stable. There is a second gate which leads to the main building. ',India
' The building was residence of Raja Surendra Pal Singh who renovated the fort even served as four time Congress MP from Bulandshahr and as a Minister of State for External Affairs. The fort came into the extended family s hands from British colonial rulers in the 1850s. ',India
' The entire place is full of pictures and artifacts from the glorious days of the place when it must have been buzzing with activity. The rooms are nice and well furnished. The staff is very polite and courteous and more than willing to serve all the time. ',India
' Everything else being nice we had a bad experience and out of 11 family members 4 of us suffered food poising   bad stomach due to some reason. We don t know if it was water or food. I advise people to be slightly cautious and avoid RO water just to eliminate the water part. ',India
' The other areas which need to be looked at are the iron chairs in the common open area where in the evening the live performance is done. These chairs become very cold and uncomfortable to sit. They must put some cushions on them. Lastly before the check in the rooms and bathrooms must checked. Out of 5 rooms that we used bathrooms of 2 rooms had problems. ',India

'  Write from memory   What a young poet has to do to win a prize with his first book ',India
'  The way we remember what s left out and what s transformed in the recapitulation.  ',India
' Rohan Chhetri a Nepali Indian poet from New Delhi has made a notable debut in poetry with his first collection Slow Startle the winner of the  Great  Indian Poetry Collective s Emerging Poets Prize. A selection of his poems punctuated by excerpts from an interview  ',India
' There are two recurring themes in the collection  memory and self actualisation. The former has to do with nostalgia of things seen felt heard while the latter is about you growing up coping and understanding the world as you know it through poetry. Would you agree  It s interesting that those are the themes you see recurring. Memory yes. The entire project of this book has to do with memory. The way we remember what s left out and what s transformed in the recapitulation. The two threads in the book the shorter poems mostly deal with a specific memory and work within it while the extended narrative of the longer poems tries to play with the act of remembering itself. ',India
' What I strive for I think and if the poems were placed chronologically in the book this would be apparent is to begin with the brighter nodes of memory   things that haven t been flushed out through passing years   and use them to move into the interstices. That s what I m more interested in moving towards. I guess self actualisation the way I think you mean it here eventually is one of the unheeded offshoots of the act of making a poem as is healing. ',India
' Your grandfather to whom this book has been dedicated has clearly played a big part in your life and writing. Are our memories of him first hand experiences or stories passed down to you  A lot of my early pursuits in writing went into working out my grandfather s death. The first death in the family this event it later occurred to me had had a deeper impact than I could ve even made sense of as a child. So naturally when I began to write poetry I gravitated towards him his legacy his famed kindness his stranglehold over the family his flaws as a human being and then finally his death. ',India
' He was a complicated man. Most of the things mentioned here are things that people remembered about him rather than my own memory. A lot of it is also me piecing together these things from eavesdropping on adult conversations as a child. ',India
' Did you start writing poems when you were very young  I started writing poems around the age of fourteen I think regurgitating a lot of what I studied in the English classes. I was in love with words first making poems out of important sounding words more than images. ',India
' Did you make notes of incidents growing up that were used in your poems or were they all written from memory  No I never made notes. I don t know if that is even possible. What gets written about is what has lasted over the years. I really depend on it  the endurance of memories that filter and age into significance. For things unresolved to turn up in new and interesting ways by association. There s a degree of accident and play without which it wouldn t be poetry at all. ',India

' Tell me a little about yourself and your tryst with poetry. It was more a tryst with literature first rather than poetry alone. I had a very interesting English teacher at St Augustine s the school I studied in in Kalimpong. His class on The Old Man and the Sea could ve possibly been the turning point that got me into all of it. ',India
' The big way poetry entered my life was perhaps with discovering the Beats Ginsberg primarily but also Corso Burroughs and Kerouac after high school. Even some of their unintelligible novels. Ginsberg s poetry at that age kind of tore open a gaping hole in my presumption of what could be written about  everything. It gave me permission to stop being genteel. It damaged my sensibility in a good way forever. I never went back to reading him again since 2008 or so though I still have a collected volume lying somewhere. ',India
' Your poetry is personal and honest telling stories with lush imagery. It s a very defined style. How did that come to be  Which poets have inspired your writing  My style bears echoes I suppose of the various poets and their works I ve read with some things I was able to bring on to what they ve done hopefully to pave the way a little further. I ve always somehow been drawn to the narrative and the story that images tell. In recent years I ve started paying more attention to sound and musicality. This book of poems written in the last seven years reflects that progress I hope. ',India

' A word fissures the dark a falling star will illuminate the sky of paper. The impersonal assembly of tenements pushes the countryside farther. I have just written down the date I ll fall dead so I can tackle this big distraction they call living. The claw marks that stand for the once loved. They talk of humanity. I know of humanity in the truth that we re beggars outside the same city of love. They talk of home. Home is one bleeding television two severed heads on a branch   a hundred year old map of a liberation that will never come. Time is killing me. Slower than my shadow I walk past them. Sure footed in the rain they seem to know where they re going. My address here is as good as anywhere. I walk slowly like one who has just begun a long tedious journey already wishing to return.

' Have you explored other genres of writing  I have. I was always writing some fiction on the side along with poetry. I m also trying to tackle a novella that I ve just begun. ',India
' So why do you think poetry as a form comes so naturally to you  Nothing comes easy or naturally. I don t write poetry every day. I wait for images the frisson certain events create and lines to ferment in my head for a long while before the first lines even emerge. But I like the process itself the slow build up. ',India
' You have been published in several online poetry journals like Rattle Mithila Review and The Missing Slate. Are you a poet who has faced his share of rejections too or has the publishing world always been kind to you  I ve had more than my fair share of rejections from all sorts of things   from magazines to book prizes and fellowships. What would I do without rejections  I d have terrible stillborn poems all over the place and the worst part is I would think they were good. It s hard to revise something once it gets published.

' Thank you for joining our tour to the East Garden of the Imperial Palace on June 29. We welcomed 15 guests from UK 2  Spain 3  USA 5  Germany 1  Canada 2  and Argentina 2 . We divided them in to 4 groups. The weather was raining at the beginning but the rain let up during our tour. Once we got into East Garden we totally forgot we were in the center of Tokyo. It was totally covered with fresh and bright green the moisture helped to make its green much more vibrant. In the main field of East Garden the construction for new Emperor s traditional ceremony Dijyo sai in November is on going but we could cover the most of the viewpoints of the tour. East Garden is originated by Edo Jyo  Edo Castle . Although there is some reconstructed old buildings it remains mostly original Edo Jyo s stonewalls. Walking in the East Garden requires your imagination like how was the Japanese life how was the social systems how the Edo Jyo was on those days and etc. This tour is not only 2 hours garden walk but also a trip to Edo era in your mind. All of our 4 groups enjoyed walking trough the moisture forest. Our tour is     ',Japan

' Thank you for your participation to Tokyo Free Walking Tour   Asakusa Route   Ueno Route  on June 23 Sunday. We welcomed 20 guests from Australia Bulgaria Germany India Switzerland UK   USA. The clouds hang low all day thus during the tours we worried when it starts to rain. But the deity of weather was on our side  Probably you might be aware that it is the rainy season in most part of Japan right now and we ve been having humid weather. Does this sound depressing  That makes sense. But let me share you some enjoyments during rainy season. The early summer rainy season is called tsuyu and written with kanji characters meaning plum rain. Because it is the when plum trees bear fruit. Water plants produces beautiful flowers such as irises and water lilies. Fireflies can be added to the attractiveness of this season. They can be found flying about at night near the clean water s edge while emitting light from their lower abdomens. The myriads of tiny blinking lights creates fantastic atmosphere. Special ceremonies Chinowa kuguri  are held at shrines on the last day of June as it marks the halfway point of the year. Stepping     ',Japan

During the tour it rained on and off but we could enjoy the tour with all of our guests. Still enjoyable many blue colors in the east side of garden. In the rainy season multiple varieties of iris and hydrangea entertain us with raindrops. So that you don t need to worry about the weather in here. Especially for the the Ninomaru garden  Japanese artificial garden  which is configured to enjoy the view for all seasons. Actually our tour guide will never get tired of this view no matter how many times we guide here   Every time we guide the tour I really enjoy chatting with our all guests. This time I could teach small talk in Japanese for some guests because they will take exam of JLPT  Japan Language Proficiency Test  in this summer. I m so grad to hear about it and know many people are interested in Japan.

And we enjoyed various kind of beautiful iris flowers in Ninomaru garden.  Typical Japanese Garden  Introducing hot springs in Japan. We Japanese love onsen  It is not too much to say that Japan is a country of onsen  hot springs . Japan is a volcanic country and one result of this is it has lots of onsen hot springs . There are some 3000 hot springs around the country. The water quality is excellent as well. There are various colors of water depending on the water quality. Although most Japanese onsen are colorless and transparent there are white water called nigoriyu brown water black water and emerald green too. It contains various minerals and provides a lot of medicinal benefits such as warming the body stimulating circulation increasing metabolism and relaxing your body and mind.

' Thank you so much for joining our tour at Meiji Jingu Shrine   Harajuku area on June 16. We welcomed 12 guests from Pakistan Singapore Malaysia Australia and France  The rainy season had already started in Tokyo but we were blessed with sun during this tour. We could enjoy to see the Japanese traditional wedding at the front of the main Pavilion of Shrine or many young people enjoying playing dress up at the Takeshita dori Street  On June 16 was the Day of Japanese Confectionery so the Shrine gave any visitors a Japanese traditional sweets and tea. In 868 the Emperor supplied gods with the sweets or dumplings for preventing the epidemic from spreading further then it worked well. We have a Japanese garden inside of the Meiji Jingu shrine and anyone can enjoy watching Japanese irises with the admission fee. One of our group visited there. Now is the flowers high season we highly recommend to visit there    reported by Hisako  ',Japan
' Many thanks to 20 guests who participated in this tour from USA Germany Spain Greece Belgium India and Indonesia. We divided into 4 groups. The weather was terrible so it was not a very comfortable tour for all of us. We really appreciated our guests  patience on that day. Actually June is a rainy season in Japan. The phrase June Bride  does not match with Japanese climate. June is not popular wedding month in Japan. In that sense the guests experienced a very typical June weather although it was not desirable for outdoor guide tour. It is recommended to enjoy indoor tours in such season. Where in Japan is best for indoor tour  How about Todai ji Temple in Nara prefecture  It is a big hall and you can view middle age made Buddha statues inside. If you are interested in Buddhism that is the place where you can spend an hour inside. Another big hall is Higashi Honganji temple in Kyoto. There is the world s biggest wooden made building. Inside is a very spacious straw mat floor that you have to take off shoes to get on. Rainy season is the time when you should think about indoor tours. Within our presenting     ',Japan

We really appreciate all guest for sharing your precious time together and enjoyed our tour and conversations with the guests. We are often inspired by unexpected questions and information from our guests and today s tours were definitely the ones. We wish our guests had the good time with us too. Speaking of time June 10 is Time Day  in Japan. It is not a national holiday but I think it is one of the candidates because there are no national holidays in June. The Emperor Tenchi who is the 38th Emperor on June 10 in 671 approximately 1350 years ago first made a water clock and made it a time clock to Otsu in current Shiga prefecture.

We divided all the guests into 2 groups and each tour took 2.5 hour with 2 or 3 guides. Fortunatelyit was cloudy and sometimes sunny in such a rainy season and our tour went smoothly with a help of wouderful guests. In this season our site is full of flowers. Blue flowers are standard and lacecap hydrangea.  Ajisai and Gakuajisai in Japanese  They are just beginning to bloom. White flower is evergreen magnoria. Taisanboku in Japanese  Big petal is impressive in early Summer. Red flower is Indian coral tree. Kaikozu in Japanese  It is a simbol tree of Kagoshima prefecture in south Japan. Highlight is a beautiful iris in Ninomaru garden. It blooms freshly and youthfully with a plenty of rainwater. This weekend or next weekend will be the best to enjoy.

On that day June 1 we welcomed around 55 guests from Australia Brazil France Germany India Myanmar Nederland New Zealand Philippine Singapore Sweden U.K. and U.S.A. Finally June has come. The month signals as the start of early summer season which tends to be Japan s rainiest time of the year.

The redbrick train station was overlooking us and it also seemed to warmly welcome our tour group as it always does. Immediately before starting the tour we made four groups for several participants in line with a few assigned guides. After a twenty minute walk from Tokyo Station we went into the East Gardens of the Imperial Palace which used be Edo Castle. This historical garden is situated in a highly urbanized area of Tokyo which is fully surrounded by busy streets and concrete buildings whereas this well preserved historical location can draw us into its peaceful and calm environment.

' The crest of hollyhock leaves was found on the bargeboard of the southern gable of the Ninomaru Palace. It is 64 centimeters in diameter. It seems that a wooden plate or copper plate with the crest carved on it was installed. When the castle s staff members checked the damage after the typhoon they detected a trace of the crest standing out on the bargeboard from which the ornamental metal fitting was detached. ',Japan
' Nijo Castle has a deep connection to the Tokugawa family. It was completed by Ieyasu in 1603 and it was at that castle where Yoshinobu the 15th shogun declared the restoration of imperial rule in 1867. It was used as an imperial villa called Nijo Imperial Villa from 1884 to 1939 when the castle was transferred to Kyoto City. ',Japan
' The current ornamental metal fittings were installed to replace hollyhock crests which were removed when the castle was used as an imperial villa. At the Karamon Gate and other locations in the castle it has been discovered that several imperial chrysanthemum crests were placed to cover up hollyhock crests. ',Japan
' Following an on the spot investigation Tamaki Goto a manager in the Nijo Castle office said The Ninomaru Palace has never been destroyed by fire or other causes. It is possible that the hollyhock crest whose trace was discovered this time could date back to the time of construction by Ieyasu and that it was originally gilded. We would like to conduct further investigation including the status of other metal fittings and hollyhock crests. ',Japan

' Snow has been the backdrop to some of Tokyo s most colorful and epoch making events. ',Japan
' When pro emperor anti foreigner activists assassinated the shogun s chief councilor Ii Naosuke outside the Sakurada Gate of Edo Castle  today s Imperial Palace  on March 3 1860 the blood that stained that day s unseasonably heavy snow signaled the death knell of the Tokugawa Shogunate. ',Japan
' When some 1500 young Imperial Japanese Army officers seeking a true Imperial restoration seized the nation s capital in an attempted coup d etat on Feb. 26 1936 Tokyo was again blanketed with snow. The coup collapsed three days later but the incident became a major turning point that eventually spurred the rise of fascism in Japan. ',Japan
' Three hundred years ago   on Dec. 14 1702   the capital was also white with snow. That night a killing occurred that has been emblematic of the essence of the samurai  ever since. To this day it is embedded deep in the Japanese psyche. ',Japan
' The event has become Japan s most famous vendetta. Known as Chushingura  literally The Treasury of Loyal Retainers  after a kabuki play on which it is based it is the story of 47 ronin  masterless samurai  who beheaded a high ranking shogunate official they held responsible for the death of their lord two years earlier. As punishment the Tokugawa Shogunate ordered the ronin to commit ritual seppuku making it the most sensational incident in the Genroku Era  1688 1704  one of the most peaceful times in the Edo Period  1603 1867 . ',Japan
' Though the story has been depicted in joruri  ballad dramas with shamisen accompaniment  kabuki and movies and told in countless books the allure of the values it embodies has never faded. ',Japan
' The Chushingura chain of events began March 14 1701 when Asano Naganori the young daimyo of the Ako domain in Harima  present day western Hyogo Prefecture  drew his sword and attacked court chamberlain Kira Yoshinaka inside Edo Castle. They had been preparing for the ceremonies to receive an Imperial mission from Kyoto later that day. Although Kira suffered serious head and back injuries he survived the attack. ',Japan
' Infuriated the Fifth Tokugawa Shogun Tsunayoshi ordered Asano to disembowel himself immediately as such assaults were strictly banned inside the castle. Lord Asano was taken into custody at the residence of his fellow Lord Tamura Ukyodayu in Shinbashi where he dutifully committed seppuku later that day. ',Japan
' With its lord s death the Ako clan was cast to the winds leaving all of its several hundred vassals without a livelihood. In accordance with its rules the shogunate also took control of Ako Castle and the clan s Edo residence  on the current site of St. Luke s College of Nursing in Tsukiji . ',Japan
' To this day however it remains unclear what caused Lord Asano to act so violently though one theory has it that the brash 34 year old daimyo from the country was unfamiliar with Edo protocol and was repeatedly humiliated by Kira a refined 60 year old noble. ',Japan
' Whatever the cause the result split the Ako clan s former vassals into two factions. While one group wanted to petition the shogunate and install Lord Asano s younger brother as head of the domain the other comprised radicals eager to take revenge on Kira. In the eyes of both the masterless vassals and the public however the shogunate s decision to order only Lord Asano to commit suicide was arbitrary and partial since the established practice was to punish both parties in a quarrel. It is said that the decision was largely influenced by Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu a close aide of the shogun who had a firm grip on power behind the scenes. Yanagisawa had cozy ties with Kira the shogunate s most experienced officer in charge of Imperial relations. As a result most believed virtually no action was taken against Kira. ',Japan
' In fact the courtier s only punishment  was his own voluntary retirement. He relocated his residence near Edo Castle to a new one he had built on an 8500 sq. meter lot in Honjo Matsuzaka near Ryogoku. It is said his move came after pressure from his neighbors in the daimyo mansion district outside the castle as they feared Ako ronin might raid his residence and they could become involved in trouble. ',Japan
' When the shogunate denied the Ako clan the right to rebuild public sentiment in Edo swung even more toward the ronin   although no one publicly supported them for fear of the authorities and their spies. In fact Tokugawa Tsunayoshi the shogun at the time is viewed as the most fearful of all the Edo Period s 15 rulers for the severity of the laws he introduced. ',Japan
' Nonetheless the Genroku Era was a time when popular culture bloomed. It saw haiku poet Matsuo Basho spreading his art of words  joruri and kabuki scriptwriter Chikamatsu Monzaemon becoming Japan s answer to Shakespeare  Hishikawa Moronobu creating the style of ukiyo e  and multitalented Ogata Korin introducing original forms of art in painting pottery and textile dyeing. ',Japan
' It was also a time of prosperity. Commoners enjoyed life on tatami mats and people started taking three meals a day sometimes even eating out at outdoor stalls selling soba and snacks. Life was even better for wealthy merchants such as Kinokuniya Bunzaemon and Naraya Monaemon who both made their fortunes in the logging business and spent their money very publicly. ',Japan
' For the nonproductive class of samurai there was little to do at this time. The shogunate system was firmly in command and there had been no major upheaval in the political capital for decades to give them a raison d etre   until Lord Asano s 47 former vassals exacted their revenge in 1702. ',Japan
' In their willingness to die for their master the ronin exhibited the true spirit of samurai living in accordance with the Bushido. Developed during the Edo Period as a code of ethics unique to the samurai class the Bushido required a samurai to live with decorum and without taint and to cultivate his fortitude and manliness. Above all a samurai was loyal and obedient to his master. ',Japan
' Though most samurai even vassals of the shogunate itself were far from well paid commoners accorded them high status. Wealthy merchants would even offer their daughters  hands in marriage to those living true to the spirit of Bushido. Indeed honorable poverty was regarded as a noble state. The contemporary saying bushi wa kuwanedo takayoji  illustrates this  A bushi should pretend he has just finished a meal by having a toothpick in the corner of his mouth rather than have others think he is hungry. ',Japan
' The 47 ronin exemplified this spirit. Led by former chief retainer Oishi Kuranosuke they spent many months singlemindedly gathering information on Kira especially his new mansion which had been converted into a mazelike fort. Disguised as doctors merchants and other professionals they repeatedly met in Kyoto Edo and other locations to exchange tips. ',Japan
' Finally on the night of Dec. 14  on the lunar calendar then in use  Jan. 30 1703 on the Western calendar  as Edo was still blanketed with unthawed snow from the day before they met at one of their hideouts in Honjo near the Kira residence. ',Japan
' Clad in black coats resembling those of firefighters with white cloth bands sewn around their sleeves to avoid friendly fire in the dark the ronin proceeded to Kira s residence. ',Japan
' Once there they sent a messenger to Tsuchiya Chikara the master of the neighboring mansion notifying him they were about to storm Kira s residence and avenge their lord and asking him not to interfere. Such was the support for the spirit of their mission that he readily agreed. ',Japan
' With that detail attended to the ronin split into two groups   one entering Kira s front gate the other from the rear. After two hours of fighting the ronin achieved their goal before dawn. As Kira s retainers were caught off guard no ronin were killed in the attack  whereas they slayed 17 of Kira s men and wounded 28. ',Japan
' From Kira s house Oishi s squad went to Sengakuji Temple near Shinagawa where their master was enshrined and offered Kira s head. But on the way to the temple Terasaka Kichiemon a low ranking foot soldier left the company for a reason no one now knows for sure. One theory holds that he was given a secret mission to report to Lord Asano s widow Yozen in who was leading a monastic life that her husband had been avenged. Another has it that he was merely scared after the raid and fled. ',Japan
' After paying homage at Sengakuji the remaining 46 ronin turned themselves over in an orderly manner to shogunate authorities. The news immediately spread throughout Edo  the public and the samurai class alike including Shogun Tsunayoshi praised their prowess and their loyalty to their lord. ',Japan
' Only 12 days after the incident the first play based on the story of the Ako ronin was performed in Edo under the title Akebono Soga no Youchi  The Night Attack at Dawn of the Sogas .  Three days later it was banned by the shogunate for fear that subversive activities might spread. The story however was too potent and it would soon be re enacted again in joruri kabuki and other dramatic forms   with subtle alterations of the characters  names. ',Japan
' Public support for the ronin s cause was strong and even the shogun was sympathetic but ultimately the shogunate had to display its control over the justice system. Until a verdict was decided the ronin were placed under house arrest at four daimyo mansions outside the castle  14 ronin including Oishi with Hosokawa Tsunatoshi of the Kumamoto domain  10 with Matsudaira Sadanao of the Matsuyama domain  10 with Mori Tsunamoto of the Choshu domain  and nine with Mizuno Tadayuki of the Okazaki domain. ',Japan
' After cautious deliberations by senior shogunal officials they concluded that the raid could be interpreted as an act of righteousness    but fatally one that stemmed from a private cause  because the ronin took revenge without having the necessary shogunal approval to do so. Thus they ruled that the ronin would be ordered to commit seppuku   the utmost courtesy for a samurai s last hurrah. ',Japan
' On Feb. 4 1703 the 46 ronin simultaneously ended their lives at the mansions where they had been accommodated. Oishi was 45 while his son Chikara was the youngest among them at 16. The oldest ronin was Horibe Yahei a retired former Edo assigned vassal at 77. Their bodies were soon enshrined next to Lord Asano s grave at Sengakuji. ',Japan
' For three centuries since the popularity of Chushingura has never waned. Right after the incident Tsuchiya Kira s neighbor testified to shogunate officials that he had been impressed by the ronin whom he described as orderly and perfectly organized. ',Japan
' There is however another admirable aspect of the behavior of the Ako ronin  They showed isagiyosa which can be interpreted as grace with pride.  The attack was carefully planned certainly no spur of the moment event and the ronin all knew they faced death. When their time to die did come they did so gracefully with pride   as samurai. ',Japan
' Although the world has changed and a story like that of the Ako ronin could never occur in the 21st century the spirit of samurai and their isagiyosa is still admired by today s Japanese. Indeed it seems all the more impressive to a public sickened by the cowardly ways of its country s political business and bureaucratic leaders. Nonetheless as long as their sense of valor and loyalty remain in the Japanese psyche the popularity of Chushingura will never melt like winter s snow. ',Japan
' Condemned but  free from taint  ',Japan
' The final verdict on the 46 Ako ronin was largely influenced by Ogyu Sorai the most respected philosopher of the time even though many shogunal officials and Confucianists were rather sympathetic to them. Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi ordered the ronin to commit ritual seppuku based on Sorai s logic. The following are excerpts from Sorai s opinion translated by Donald Keene in his book Chushingura   Charles E. Tuttle Co.   ',Japan
' By righteousness we mean the path of keeping oneself free from any taint and by law we mean the measuring rod for the entire country. ',Japan
' A man controls his heart with decorum and his actions with righteousness. ',Japan
' For the 46 samurai to have avenged their master on this occasion shows that they are aware of shame as becomes men who are samurai  and since they have followed the path of keeping themselves free from taint their deed is righteous. ',Japan
' However this deed is ap propriate only to their particular group  it amounts therefore to a special exception to the rules. ',Japan
' The persons connected with the vendetta considered Kira to be their enemy because Asano Naganori was punished for his disorderly behavior in  Edo Castle  and they deliberately planned an act of violence without official permission. This is not to be tolerated under the law. ',Japan
' If the 46 samurai are pronounced guilty and con demned to commit seppuku in keeping with the traditions of the samurai the claim of the Uesugi family  Kira s wife s family which was one of the most powerful clans at the time  will be satisfied and the loyalty of the men will not have been disparaged. ',Japan
' This must therefore be considered as a general principle. If general principles are impaired by special exceptions there will no longer be any respect for the law in this country. ',Japan
' TV Tokyo and its network stations nationwide will air a 10 hour drama on Chushingura starting at 2 p.m. on Jan. 2 as its new year showcase program. Featuring one of the leading kabuki actors Nakamura Kichiemon as Oishi Kuranosuke Chushingura  Ketsudan no Toki  Time for Decision   adopts the framework of Kanadehon Chushingura  which was first performed in 1748 and is still a popular kabuki production. The drama will also feature veteran actress Hitomi Kuroki as Oishi s wife Riku  Takaya Kamikawa as Asano Naganori  and Ko Hashizume as Kira Yoshinaka. Events to commemorate the 47 ronin are held annually at Sengakuji Temple Dec. 14 15. For more information see The Japan Times  festival listings at www.japantimes.co.jp festivals.htm ',Japan

This was very different to Edo now modern day Tokyo with its shogunate castle surrounded by a moat situated at the city center a convention that was later standardized for other daimyo controled cities.

Josephson Storm Ioannis Gaitanidis Ellen Van Goethem Carina Roth Andrea De Antoni Rebecca Suter Mauro Arrighi Jolyon Baraka Thomas Andrea Castiglioni  Animated City  Life Force Guardians and Contemporary Architecture in Kyoto Bloomsbury Publishing 2019.04 Like practitioners of many other occupations architects are often asked to justify the meaning behind their creations or are required to envelop their proposals in appealing narratives to attract clients to promote their projects or to convince neighbors city authorities and competition jurors. In this chapter I explore the long held conviction that Kyoto is a city animated by various invisible agencies and how this notion has influenced its architecture between the 1990s and the early 2000s. Inspired by the belief that the city was designed and built in the late eighth century according to the core principles of site divination  popularly known as geomancy or fengshui     Ch. f ng shu  Jp. f sui    it is generally assumed that Kyoto is vitalized by the invisible flow of qi  Ch. q    Jp. ki   life force  or cosmic breath   and protected by the guardians of the four directions. Starting in the 1990s when a fengshui boom gripped Japan several architectural projects in Kyoto were conceived announced or justified with explicit reference to these practices either because of the architect s personal beliefs a particular client s request or to convince the general public of the project s suitability to the city. Be it implicitly or explicitly from the outset or post hoc fengshui derived concepts informed  at least in part and for different reasons  the design of the architectural projects discussed here. Moreover it will become clear that the three architects behind the projects Hara Hiroshi     Isozaki Arata     and Umebayashi Katsu     each differ in their level of commitment to fengshui ranging from a near total immersion to a more casual engagement with and isolated application of its principles..

' Ellen Van Goethem The Four Directional Animals in East Asia  A Comparative Analysis Asien  und Afrika Studien der Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin 38 201 216 2011.11 In this paper  I present some tentative conclusions about the comparative research I have been conducting into the way s  in which the four creatures that each guard one of the  cardinal  directions are represented in the physical landscape within the practice s  of geophysical divination. In China in Korea as well as in Japan these four directional beasts are identified as the Black Turtle Snake      of the back north  the Vermilion Bird      of the front south the Azure Dragon      of the left east and the White Tiger      of the right west. However the earliest texts on divination remain vague about the specific landscape features corresponding to each of the four mythical animals. In later times at least two co existing traditions seem to have developed within the practice of site divination in East Asia. Following one tradition emphasis lay on the presence of natural features with all four animals represented in the landscape as mountains. Another tradition however required the presence of a different natural or man made landscape feature for each of the four beasts. This paper focuses on the latter tradition in Japanese referred to as shijin s          correspondence to the four deities  . Through an investigation of written sources this paper will trace the origin and evolution of the observances of shijin s   as well as provide a basic analysis of the different textual traditions. Furthermore this paper will challenge the commonly held view that the practice of shijin s   was a divination process used to determine the location of capital cities.. ',Japan

' Ellen E. M. A. Van Goethem Of Trees and Beasts  Site Selection in Premodern East Asia The Third Conference of East Asian Environmental History  EAEH  2015.10  URL  Since ancient times people in the Chinese cultural sphere have been looking for ideal sites to construct graves found cities build houses etc. These practices are generally grouped under the broad label of telluric divination or geomancy  Chn.    fengshui . This paper focuses on a subcategory within telluric divination  it concentrates on a practice that received its own label shijin s        or correspondence to the four deities  in Japan but is in no way unique to the country. In China Korea and Japan a number of written sources dating from the 8th through 19th centuries describe the ideal siting conditions of private residences. What these sources have in common is that a residence needs to be surrounded by specific landscape features either natural or manmade  a river an irrigated plain a road and a hill  each corresponding to one of the four directional deities  the Azure Dragon the Vermilion Bird the White Tiger and the Black Turtle Snake . Inhabitants of a site that corresponds to these topographical requirements are promised good health and a long life a successful career and numerous descendants. Interestingly several of the written sources describing these ideal siting conditions also provide a practical and in most cases realizable solution to remedy any shortcomings in the surrounding topography in the form of substituting missing landscape features with specific  numbers of  trees. This paper will thus compare and contrast a number of these sources to address the underlying philosophy of substituting landscape features for trees as well as issues of knowledge transfer..

' Ellen E. M. A. Van Goethem Foreign Beliefs in  Native  Settings  Fengshui Elements in Shinto Shrines ICAS  International Convention of Asia Scholars  2015.07 The earliest evidence of the presence of fengshui related practices on the Japanese archipelago dates back to nearly two millennia ago. At that time there was no unified systematized or institutionalized indigenous religion. The loose set of native rituals and practices performed at the time is classified by scholars as kami worship and over the centuries that followed it was receptive of a wide variety of rites symbolism and beliefs belonging to imported religious traditions including Buddhism Confucianism and Christianity. This process of absorption did not come to a halt when kami related worship was systematized into what we now call Shinto. Close inspection of Shinto prayers and rites conducted at shrines reveals the pervasive influence of imported elements in this so called native religion. To illustrate this point this paper focuses on the famous Daizaifu Tenmangu shrine in Kyushu. Dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane  845 903  who was deified after his death and is still worshipped as a paragon of refinement and scholarship the shrine draws thousands of visitors and has been designated an Important Cultural Property. The shrine is thus portrayed as a symbol of Japan eseness  and its native religion. Scratching the surface however it quickly becomes clear that the core of the shrine s most important ritual the rice planting festival and the norito  ritual prayers  recited at the Dazaifu Tenmangu shrine are replete with fengshui related references..

' Ellen E. M. A. Van Goethem Adopting and adapting the paradigm  Gridiron cities in Japan International Institute for Asian Studies 2013.11  URL  Using the example of capital cities this paper will address the issue of cultural borrowing and the subsequent modification of imported ideas in ancient Japan. It is common knowledge that during the early centuries CE the ruling elites of the Japanese archipelago were heavily dependent on Chinese archetypes and prototypes for the formation of the early state. Unquestionably one of the most visually striking and impressive examples of this process of cultural borrowing was the establishment of large semi permanent urban centers. Laid out on a gridiron pattern with a clearly delineated space reserved for the ruler s residential quarters as well as for the apparatus of government itself also mostly newly introduced these cities symbolized the power of the ruler and the political social and cultural center of the recently emerged state. In order to explain how the Chinese archetype was adopted and adapted this paper will briefly trace the evolution of gridiron cities. Then it will address the process of selecting a suitable site for the establishment of these cities. This process is commonly addressed only briefly by referring to lofty ideals and or to esoteric practices but has received little scholarly attention so far.. ',Japan

' In this presentation a number of inscribed wooden tablets  mokkan     are presented to illustrate how their discovery has deepened our understanding of specific aspects of the Nagaokakyo era. Prior to the discovery of these wooden tablets only a limited number of written sources contemporaneous to the Nagaoka capital s existence were available to scholars. In the four decades since the discovery of the first inscribed wooden tablet in the remains of the former capital this vast body of written evidence has also proved to be a valuable addition to the archaeological record of the Nagaoka capital..

' In the School of Letters I teach courses related to premodern Japanese history and history of ideas as well as courses on East West interaction. In the International Master s Program  IMAP  and Doctorate  IDOC  in Japanese Humanities I teach graduate seminars that offer an in depth examination of specific aspects of Japanese history. Other courses aim to familiarize the students with source materials available for the study of ancient Japan including documents inscriptions architecture landscapes pottery and other archaeological finds. While the main focus in these courses is on developments within what is now Japan I occasionally touch on relevant developments in China or on the Korean peninsula. I co teach a week long fieldwork course during which the students visit major historical and archaeological sites and a yearlong course of one day excursions to cultural historical and archaeological sites in the Kyushu area. Finally during the Research Readings and Methods courses and the Master s Thesis Guidance sessions I introduce students to advanced research methodologies additional source materials and help them to develop their scholarly writing and presentation skills.

Before travelling when I was considering which parts of Scotland I should visit apart form Edinburgh the pictures I saw of Glencoe in a guidebook charmed me the most. They were photographs of moors. I could imagine the feeling of clear and cool air when I saw the pictures. Therefore I thought that Glencoe was the No.1 place to visit   and in reality when I visited Scotland Glencoe was very special. ',Japan

'   Our travel was during Obon which is an extremely busy time so we couldn t book the return part of our ticket   finally we got it just 1 week before the departure. We thought that it was impossible to find a B B in Edinburgh because it was during the Edinburgh Festival and decided to stay in Linlithgow near Edinburgh. However when we arrived there in the evening we found out that our decision was wrong.   We couln t find a B B easily. The B B which we finally found after asking some people was a small place so it was already full. Luckily the proprietor of the B B was so kind that they gave us some advice. Did you come here by car  Therefore you can get to Bo ness in 30 minutes. I think there are more B B in Bo ness. If you go immediately you ll be there before the tourist information center closes.   Fortunately on the way to Bo ness we found a B B in Linlithgow. We asked if a room was available and luckily the answer was yes   We had to share a bath and a toilet. However we couldn t ask for too much. It cost around   14 per person. It was the cheapest place we stayed at. ',Japan
' The 5th day   Because we couldn t find a B B to stay at easily the day before we decided we should book a place to stay that morning. As we had been advised we drove to Bo ness and went to the tourist information center. However it was too early   the center wasn t open.   My cousin said We passed a hotel on the way here. Why don t we ask if a room is available    Contrary to our expectation they said that there was a twin room available and it would cost us only   25  Of course we took it. The building of the hotel was like a motel and modern. The room had a well equipped bathroom. I had thought that I wanted to stay at B Bs when I traveled the countryside in England and Scotland however I liked the hotel. It was very cosy.   I realized that I like well equipped modern accomodation. ',Japan

'   The weather had been fine although we had had a few sun showers. However it rained for half a day when we visited Edinburgh Castle. They say that when Queen Mary gave birth to James the first in Edinburgh Castle she already hated her husband   also James didn t like the castle so much. Therefore my impressions of Edinburgh Castle was also gloomy. Moreover because of the rain it became increasingly depressing    In the afternoon after the rain stopped we visited the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It is a palace which Queen Elizabeth  Uoften visits. I really enjoyed seeing the inside of the palace and the grounds. One reason was probably because I hadn t expected to visit the palace. In fact Holyroodhouse is my No.1 recommended place to visit in Edinburgh. ',Japan

' 1.  nbsp nbsp nbspThe recent controversy in connection with the adoption of history textbooks at the middle school is nothing but a storm in a teacup.  nbsp Because all the textbooks including the so called new history textbook and the conventional history textbooks are sharing the same stand of the government view history compiled after the Meiji Restoration.  nbsp nbsp nbspIt is the stand of the ultra nationalism which explains the history of Japan solely from the viewpoint of the unitarian Emperor worship and excludes all the historical facts which do not get along with such viewpoint.  nbsp nbsp nbspIt has indeed continued to prevail for these 130 years ever since the Meiji Restoration. As a result the Japanese people were continuously brain washed by the dishonest history textbooks and getting reproduced in a great large number over the four eras of Meiji Taisho Showa and Heisei. The Japanese people were deeply addicted to such viewpoint that they are not even aware of the fact they have been poisoned. How dangerous it is  ',Japan
' 2  nbsp nbsp nbsp On the other hand the Chinese history books frankly told the truth of the Japanese history as a neighbor.  nbsp nbsp nbsp In China the authentic chronicles of its dynasties have been written continuously since the 2nd century B. C.  Shiji . As soon as one dynasty ceased to exist Chinese described the history of their previous dynasty. They are indeed a rare great recorder in the world.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Since the 1st century A.D.  Hanshu  those authentic history books continued to write about the neighboring country the state of Wa  i. e. the western part of the Japan archipelago.  nbsp nbsp nbspThe first example is the golden seal. It was written in a book that China s latter Han dynasty bestowed it on Wa in 57 A.D.. Actually the golden seal was unearthed in the Shika island at the Hakata bay on a northern coast in Kyushu. The second example is the report the Sui s mission. On the basis of the mission s report the Sui history book wrote about famous mountains in Kyushu. Special to note is a report saying there was Mt. Aso with its erupting fire rising up to the sky. Mt. Aso is a living volcano in Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu. The Sui history book of the 7th century also wrote about emperors of the rising sun. Therefore it seems clear that the capital of the Wa state was at Dazaifu of Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu.  nbsp nbsp nbsp By the way at Dazaifu there still exist such village section names as Shishinden  the Hall for state Ceremonies Dairi  the Imperial Palace   and Suzakumon  the Southern Gate to the Capital . These are the proofs that there were once places concerning emperors.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Furthermore the China s Tang dynasty had had close relations with Japan. It had two old and new history books. About Japan both of them wrote about Japan as Wa state centering in Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu before the end of the 7th century and as Nihon or Nippon state in Nara or Kyoto Prefecture in Kinki after the 8th century. The Tang dynasty having relations with Japan may never make any mistakes about the fundamental international facts. ',Japan
' 3  nbsp nbsp nbsp The truth may remain undistorted and talk itself eloquently however harsh a onetime regime brainwash its nation with a dishonest history.  nbsp nbsp nbspThe following map will testify the truth  ',Japan
'  nbsp nbsp nbspThese are the sites of ancient fortress ruins called Kogoishi.  nbsp nbsp nbspAround the midslope of the mountains at the height between several hundreds and a thousand meters brick shaped stones cut from big stones were laid to build the bases of doubly made outer walls of mountain fortresses.  nbsp nbsp Without an exception a water gate was attached to them. It was a water supply facility for soldiers and people who stay in the mountain castle in case of enemy invasions.  nbsp nbsp nbspI believe that they are the ruins of military fortress made in preparation for the possible invasion of foreign enemies such as Kokuryo Shilla and Tanng s China.  nbsp nbsp nbspMeanwhile Japanese academics had thought that they were made in the period between the 6th and 7th centuries.  nbsp nbsp nbspHowever recent dendrochronology has revealed that in 70 to 80  cases the results of the conventional archeological chronology by pottery should go back for about 100 years.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Accordingly those Kogoishi ancient fortress ruins should go back to the 5th and 6th centuries.  nbsp nbsp nbspThen the question arises about who made those military fortresses. I think that the political power situated in the center of the surrounding fortresses did. This area is composed of Chikushi  Fukuoka Prefecture  and Hizen  Saga Prefecture . It is clear that the Emperor in Kinki  Nara and Kyoto  had nothing to do with them.  nbsp nbsp nbspThis fact is very obvious. But the government compiled history after Meiji closed its eyes and cut of the map from the textbooks.  nbsp nbsp nbspAs a matter of fact these military fortresses had been constructed before the big war. You may remember that the allied forces of Tang s China and Shilla won the sea battle of Hakusukinoe off Paekche in 662 or 663 A. D. against the allied forces of Wa and Paekche.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Nevertheless today s Japanese academics and all textbooks have propagandized since Meiji that Queen Suiko and Prince Shotoku of Kink in the first half of the 7th century were the central power of the Japan archipelago.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Therefore I dare say that they are completely dishonest. ',Japan
' 4 nbsp nbsp nbsp During the Edo isolation period fanatic ultra nationalism was developed. It influenced the Mito school of Confucianism on one hand and the Kokugaku school of the Study of Japanese Classical Literature on the other hand. Both of them had a great influence over the development of the spirit of the Meiji Restoration in 1868. After the Meiji Restoration the two schools cooperated to build a nationalistic ideology called Shinto fundamentalism. Their image history has built up the basis of Japanese thoughts for 130 years since then.  nbsp nbsp nbspAlthough freedom of study and thought was superficially permitted and different opinions were also permitted to express after the defeat of the war in 1945 Japanese scholars living on history as their profession made it their secret art of living by not touching the Kyushu dynasty for discussion. In these suffocated circumstances creativity of human being will never be possible.  nbsp nbsp nbspI am very happy to express my thoughts expecting human reason because I believe that foreign correspondents are certainly not contaminated by the brainwashing of the history image of Japanese ultra nationalism.

' Kites have been objects of interest and fascination to people throughout the world for at least 2000 years. Some people think that kites may have been invented even earlier suggesting that kites were being flown in China as long ago as 1000 BC. Unless new information comes to light we have no real way of determining when they were invented who invented them or even which country they were first used in. Kites are normally made from light and quite fragile materials and we have very few actual examples of kites that are more than two hundred years old. Unlike other artifacts such as pots and stone or metal tools almost everything used to make a kite could rot or be burnt. Archeologists find out much of what they know about a culture from sources such as rubbish tips. Kites would not last long in this sort of environment. As we don t have the actual kites we have to rely on traditions legends illustrations and documents to chart the historical development of kites. ',Japan
' It is currently thought that kites may have been independently invented in both China and Malaysia and that this new invention then spread through the rest of Asia from these two countries. There certainly is documentary evidence to suggest that kites were being flown in China as long ago as 200 BC. when a general in the Han dynasty is recorded as having used a kite as an instrument of war by using it as a method of determining the correct distance to dig a tunnel to enter a palace and end a siege. Other Chinese legends relate how kites were used to lift fireworks in order to terrify an opposing army and how they were used to lift observers before a battle. Other uses for kites in Asia included a novel way of fishing  also practised in New Zealand  scaring birds from crops as a way of lifting construction materials to the tops of buildings and as a toy. In some Asian countries the kite had considerable religious significance. In Korea newly born children had kites flown and released for them taking away any bad luck they had been born with. Kites were flown by farmers in Thailand at the time of the monsoon to ask the gods to make the monsoon winds blow long enough to prevent all the rain falling on their crops and flooding them. ',Japan
' Japanese legends describe how a thief attempted to steal golden scales from a statue of a dolphin on the roof of Nagoya Castle by using a kite to lift him over the walls and onto the roof without alerting the guards. His scheme failed and he and his family were put to death by being boiled in oil. Japan became an important focal point for kites because of its geographical location. They were brought to Japan from China by Buddhist missionaries in the seventh century. From here kites spread throughout the Pacific region carried by Japanese traders and explorers. ',Japan
' Kites were introduced to Europe by explorers returning from Asia. Marco Polo an Italian explorer who returned from China in 1295 wrote remarkably accurate accounts of the construction of kites as well as how they were flown. The first known reference to kite flying in Europe appears in a manuscript about military technology written in 1405. Another text written in 1430 describes how to make a kite from parchment and explains how to connect the flying line to different points on the kite in order for the kite to fly well in a variety of wind conditions. Two other books written in 1589 and 1634 both recommend using kites to lift fireworks at night. An illustration of the town of Middelburg Holland made in 1618 shows children flying kites of the diamond shape so common today. In Europe unlike Asia kites were regarded simply as harmless toys for children to play with. In the following few centuries that view was to change dramatically. ',Japan
' In eighteenth century Europe the kite showed its usefulness asa scientific instrument. In 1749 a Scottish meteorologist named Alexander Wilson used kites to lift thermometers to a height of 3000 feet to measure temperature variations at altitude. Three years later Benjamin Franklin used a kite to demonstrate that lightning was similar to the static electricity that scientists were experimenting with at the time. By flying a kite in an electrical storm he was able to observe sparks coming from a key he had suspended from the flying line. Until that time there had been no direct evidence that lightning was an electric current travelling from the ground to the storm cloud. Franklin s experiments led to the development of the lightning conductor and placed him so high in the regard of the French people that he was able to travel to France during the American war of independence and obtain financial and military aid for the Americans. ',Japan
' Sir George Cayley experimented with kites between 1799 and 1809 in the quest to develop a heavier than air flying machine capable of carrying a passenger. He was the first person to describe scientifically the problems that would have to be overcome before man would fly in such a machine. ',Japan
' From kites Cayley moved to gliders that incorporated two kite shaped wings. His experiments culminated in 1853 in a full sized glider that supported the weight of one of his servants on a flight that lasted perhaps 40 seconds  after the flight the coachman promptly resigned . Cayley had identified the separate properties of lift thrust and drag and made a number of prophetic suggestions about what he called aerial navigation. ',Japan
' By 1826 George Pocock had patented a four stringed kite used for pulling carriages. The four strings allowed the kite to be controlled so that the carriage it pulled behaved much like a sailboat and could even tack into the wind. The carriage apparently was capable of reaching speeds of 30 km h. ',Japan
' Through the latter half of the nineteenth century a number of people experimented with kites as a lifesaving device. It was anticipated that some of these would be carried on the ship and flown onto the lee shore if the ship was wrecked. Once the kite had been retrieved by people on the shore heavier lines could be drawn out by the kite s flying line until a cable strong enough to carry the weight of an adult could be passed from the ship to the shore and a rescue of the crew and passengers effected by a breeches buoy basically a seat suspended from a pulley that could be pulled along a supporting line. Whilst the idea is good there is no recorded rescue using these methods. ',Japan
' In 1833 a British meteorologist E. D. Archibold started using kites to lift anemometers to measure wind speed at various altitudes. Meteorological observatories around the world used kites to lift instruments thousands of feet into the air. This gave a great deal of information about the atmosphere and vastly improved the weather forecasting of the time. Kites were to continue in this role until the mid 1930s when aircraft and radiosonde balloons finally replaced them. In 1887 Archibold was the first person to take an aerial photograph from a kite an application that is still practised today. Kites have been used as a cheap alternative method of obtaining aerial photographs of archeological sites reefs and the remains of shipwrecks. A photograph taken from even a comparatively short distance above ground level can show details not readily apparent from the ground. ',Japan
' By the late nineteenth century kites were being seen as serious scientific instruments. Kites were seen as a good starting point in the development of powered heavier than air flying machines. Potential aeroplane builders were tackling the problems of powered flight in a more disciplined manner making small steps forward and discovering their new craft as they went along. Rather than trying to create a flying machine in one step the more careful experimenters worked on one problem at a time solving each small part of the puzzle and then and only then bringing all the parts together in an attempt to build a working aircraft. There were still many people who did not believe that it was possible for a heavier than air machine to fly amongst them being Professor Simon Newcomb  a well respected astronomer and in 1903 the only American since Benjamin Franklin to be made an Associate of the Institute of France  and Rear Admiral George Melville chief engineer for the United States Navy. Even after the Wright brothers had flown there were many people saying that powered flight was impossible. In hindsight it seems strange that such a world changing event was virtually ignored until several years after the fact. ',Japan
' Throughout Europe and America experiments were being undertaken to determine the best sort of design for powered aircraft. The Wright brothers were by no means the only people trying to build an aeroplane  they were simply the first to achieve powered and controllable flight. There were still many fanciful designs being touted as the solution to the problem of powered flight  human powered flapping wings built onto a bicycle being but one example  but in the main the advocates of powered flight were making gradual but definite progress towards overcoming the intricacies of lift thrust drag stability and control. Lawrence Hargrave experimented near Sydney in the 1890s with a number of kite designs. He finally settled upon what he called a cellular or box kite. He was looking for a stable lifting surface to which he could add an engine. His experiments led to the development of the cambered aerofoil a feature that generated much more lift than a flat surface. Put simply a curved wing surface causes the air traveling over the upper surface to move faster and travel further than the air passing along the lower surface of the wing. The air passing over the top surface has a slightly reduced pressure. The greater pressure below the wing exerts an upwards force called lift and within certain limits increases with airspeed. ',Japan
' Some of Hargrave s later gliding kites were so efficient that they flew at angles of up to 110 degrees. The kite could well be further into the wind than its tether point which caused a problem if the wind dropped. Hargrave solved this problem by flying this style of kite from a trapeze like structure which prevented the kite from reaching the ground if the wind did ease at all. ',Japan
' Most kites fly at angle of less than 50 degrees above the horizon. Efficient kites normally fly at angles of up to 70 degrees. The reason Hargrave s gliding kites flew so well was due to the shape of the wing he developed. It was shaped very much like the cross section of a modern aeroplane wing with a slight reflex curve at the trailing edge producing enough just enough drag to stop the kite falling forwards into the wind. ',Japan
' The cambered aerofoil is the basis of the shape of all aircraft wings today. In his quest for a light power source he also invented the rotary engine. Unfortunately he was unable to overcome the weight problems that beset so many of the early aviation pioneers and his dream of a full sized powered box kite never came to pass. In the course of his research he presented 23 papers and exhibitions to the Royal Society of New South Wales on aviation related topics. Hargrave was more interested in solving the problem of powered flight than in being the person to do it. He did not patent any of his inventions preferring their benefits to be available to all researchers into the development of the aeroplane. In Australia his achievements are acknowledged by a statue at Stanwell Park New South Wales where he carried out his experiments his likeness and some of his gliders may be seen on one side of our twenty dollar note and the engineering and science library at Monash University is named after him. Ironically the only museum Hargrave was able to pursuade to display his collection of revolutionary kites was in Berlin. His kites which had helped in the development of powered flight were destroyed in the bombing of Germany during the second world war. ',Japan
' The Wright brothers eventually overcame these weight problems and flew an aeroplane of their own design in 1903. This was the climax of several years of experimentation using kites and gliders. The wing warping system they used to control their aeroplane had been developed by flying their smaller versions as kites and twisting the wings with four lines from the ground. Because of their extensive flying of their designs as kites and their use of wind tunnels to test ideas about wings and propellers they were able to collect a great deal of information about the stability of their designs as well as the amount of lift the glider developed for a given wind. This gave them invaluable information about the necessary size and curvature for the wings of their 1903 flyer. ',Japan
' Alexander Graham Bell was also trying to invent the first powered aeroplane. He knew of the work being undertaken by Hargrave and he also experimented with kites to determine the most suitable lifting surface. He finally settled on a cellular kite made of regular tetrahedrons  the shape is best known now as that of the tetra pack that Sunny Boys and similar icy poles come in a pyramid with four triangular sides .

' Later he and a number of like minded people set up an association with the express purpose of developing an aeroplane. This association included Tom Selfridge who later became the first person to die in an aeroplane when he and Wilbur Wright crashed whilst conducting trials for the United Stated Army and Glenn Curtis who later became one of the first aircraft manufacturers in America. Curtis later had to defend himself in court against the Wright brothers who claimed an exclusive patent on the aeroplane. ',Japan
' Kites were used as an observation device during both the first and second world wars. They were used as a means of increasing the range of visibility by German submarines during both of these wars. At water level an observer might be able to see 8 kilometers but by using a kite to lift that observer to a height of 400 feet visibility could be increased to 40 kilometers. When keeping a lookout for enemy ships such an increase of range was definitely an advantage. During the second world war kites were supplied as standard equipment in life rafts on British and Australian aircraft. If the raft had to be used the kite could be used to lift the antennae of an emergency radio transmitter. The kite was also used as an airborne sail  although the speed of the raft through the water was quite low it did help to stabilize the boat in rough seas. Kites with two control lines were developed by a U. S. Navy Commander during the second world war as a means of training naval antiaircraft gunners. Paul Garber s kite was highly manoeuvrable and was used in target practice. The kite was said to be quite hard to hit as it moved around the sky at the command of its pilot who was safely on the ground. Paul Garber had seen the Wright brothers demonstrate their aircraft to the US. Army in 1909 and later became the curator of the Smithsonian Institute which holds the largest collection of aviation related artifacts in the world. ',Japan
' Kites again attracted attention in the 1950s and 1960s when Francis Rogallo developed a completely flexible kite with no rigid supporting spars. Instead of spars this kite uses the wind itself to hold it open and maintain its shape. Rogallo was an aeronautical engineer working for NASA. He was searching for a controllable recovery system for spacecraft. This kite was the first to be developed with the assistance of wind tunnel testing and is an indication of how far kites have come since they were simply a child s toy. The Rogallo wing rather than being used just as a kite has been put to numerous uses by the American military and is the basis for hang gliders and through them for many of the ultralight aircraft designs being flown today. ',Japan
' Another recent and widely used kite is the parafoil. It too has no spars sticks or other form of rigid bracing. It is a true aerofoil using the force of the wind to inflate the kite and maintain its shape. Of all kite designs this style gives the greatest amount of lift known to date. This design has been developed into steerable parachutes and is the basis of the paraglider a non rigid hang glider. With the development of the parafoil the evolution of the kite has undergone a new twist. Rather than aeroplanes imitating the shape and form of kites as happened at the end of the last and the beginning of this century kites are now starting to imitate the form of the aeroplane. ',Japan
' Manoeuvrable kites. ',Japan
' Kites have undergone a resurgence of interest recently. This is due mainly to the development of sport kites. These kites use two lines rather than one and may be steered around the sky often at speeds in excess of 100 kilometers per hour. Kites have also been developed which use four lines allowing the user to alter the angle the kite presents to the wind and so control forward and backward motion of the kite. As wonderful as these kites are manoeuvrable kites are not new. They have been used for centuries in one form or another around the world. ',Japan
' The oldest form of manoeuvrable kite was developed in Asia and uses one string rather than two to control it. Traditionally this sort of kite is made from tissue paper and bamboo. It is thought that it originally developed in China and then spread throughout the rest of Asia carried by explorers and Buddhist monks. This kite is made of flexible materials and is manoeuvered by pulling in or releasing line. When the line is pulled in the kite bends at the wingtips and becomes stable. In its bowed state it will fly in a straight line. When line is released the kite becomes flat and unstable. It will then tumble or spin. When the kite is pointing in the direction the flier wants it to go line is pulled in bowing the kite again and causing it to fly in a straight line along its new course. The amount of control over a kite of this style depends upon the skills of the flier and competitions to see who has the most skill are very common in Asia. This competition takes the form of a fight. The flying line normally button thread has part of its length coated with a mixture of glue and powdered glass or pottery making the line extremely abrasive. During the fight both contestants attempt to manoeuver their kites around the flying line of their opposition and when this has been achieved a sawing motion is all that is needed to wear through their opponent s flying line. For this reason this style of kite is commonly called a fighting kite. ',Japan
' More general contests or festivals also take place especially in India. The largest and oldest kite festival in the world takes place in Ahmedabad on the 14th of January of every year. This festival is a free for all with perhaps 100 000 kites in the sky at once all trying to cut each other down. The festival has been celebrated for centuries at the time that the winter solstice has passed and the sun has again climbed above the constellation of Capricorn. The festival is called Makar Sankranti which means the conclusion of Capricorn. Tales of kite fighting are found in the Sanskrit religious writings of the Veda and in the epic the Ramayana. The importance of kites in India is suggested by the Hindi language which has more than 100 different words for kite. ',Japan
' Thailand Malaysia Japan and Korea also have their own kite fighting traditions as well as their own traditional kite designs. The fighting kites of Japan are normally rectangular or hexagonal and can be big enough to require teams of up to 50 men to control them. It has been suggested that fighting kites developed in Japan as a method of solving disputes between neighbouring villages as a sort of aerial trial by combat. The city of Nagasaki one of the only points of contacts between Japan and the early European explorers during the time that Japan maintained an isolationist policy has a traditional fighting kite called the Hata. It is very similar in shape to the Indian fighter and is traditionally painted in the red white and blue colour scheme of the Dutch flag and the English translation of Hata means flag. Because the tradition of flying this style of kite in Japan is only found around Nagasaki it is commonly thought that the kite derives from Indian fighters brought to Japan by Dutch explorers and merchants. ',Japan
' Multiple line kites aren t new in Europe either. By 1826 George Pocock had used 4 stringed kites to pull carriages through the English countryside. These flying lines were used to allow the kites to be manoeuvered like the sails of a boat and just like a sailboat his kite drawn vehicle could actually tack into the wind. Other kites using more than one line were developed later in the nineteenth century mainly as devices for carrying rescue equipment to shipwrecks but it wasn t until the Second World War that kites using two lines were flown in the manner we are accustomed to today. Paul Garber s Navy Target Kite could be controlled by means of a rudder attached to the back of the kite and was used to give gunners on ships practice against a moving target. By the end of the war over 300000 of the kites had been distributed amongst American military forces around the world. ',Japan
' In the 1960s a number of dual control kites came on to the market but it wasn t until 1972 when the Peter Powell Stunt Kite was released that stunt kites became really popular. This diamond shaped kite was relatively cheap was easy to fly and used an extremely long inflatable tail that allowed people to sign write with their kite. It originally used aluminium spars and a plastic sail but later models used fibreglass spars and a ripstop nylon sail for increased durability. This kite is still in production today and remains a very popular design. ',Japan
' Since the development of the Peter Powell kite there have been many other innovations. One style of kite that has developed is called the Flexifoil basically a kite shaped like an aeroplane wing. Although very similar in design to a parafoil it differs in that it has no fins or keels and instead has a spar running along the front edge of the kite to hold it open. This kite develops incredible amounts of lift and can fly in an arc across the wind at speeds well in excess of 160 kilometers per hour. As the speed of this kite increases so does the amount of lift. Large versions of this kite easily drag people across flying fields and a recent innovation has been to water ski behind this style of kite. ',Japan
' The most common style of stunt kite is based on the delta wing. Shaped like hang gliders these kites make use of materials initially developed by the aerospace industry for high performance aeroplanes and spacecraft. Materials such as kevlar and spectra have properties such as very low stretch factors and remarkable strength to diameter ratios. Kevlar is used in the production of bullet proof vests whilst spectra is used in the tethers astronauts use when they work outside their spacecraft. These materials are also used in the manufacture of flying lines for high performance kites. A flying line made of spectra no thicker than ordinary sewing thread has a breaking strain of over 50 kilograms and will stretch less than one percent of its length. A nylon line of similar breaking strain would be around six times as thick and would have a stretch factor of about twenty percent. The spars used in many high performance kites are made from carbon fibre a non metallic material developed for use in Stealth aircraft as it doesn t show up on radar. Many other uses have been found for these sorts of materials as they have become more readily available and costs have been reduced. ',Japan
' The most recent development in kites has been the reintroduction of kites with four lines. These quad line kites can be flown forwards backwards or sidewards and may even be made to hover. The space age materials are new but the idea isn t  the Wright brothers used four lines on the models they built to test their ideas about wing warping. The flier holds two handles with lines attached to the top and bottom of both of them. Twisting the handles forwards or backwards alters the angle of the kite and it is possible to use the whole kite as a sort of combination elevator and aileron and so alter the angle that one or both sides of the kite meets the wind. By pulling the top of the kite further into the wind the kite will fly forwards. Pulling the bottom of the kite further into the wind will cause the kite to fly backwards. If the bottom of one side of the kite is pulled into the wind the kite will turn in that direction as this side of the kite no longer generates as much lift. These kites are quite difficult to fly but do give the flier an exceptional opportunity to learn about how the angle of a kite in the wind affects its flight. ',Japan
' The popularity of dual control and quad line kites has had a marked influence on kites in general. Kites are more popular now than at any previous time in history. While the manoeuvrable kites have captured the imagination of many there are also many people who have discovered the beauty and peacefulness of single line flying. The materials that have been used for manouevrable kites are now being used for single line kites as well giving kite makers greater scope for creative endeavour. Their creations are becoming bigger and bigger and the general public is taking more notice of them. During 1992 and 1993 there were two exhibitions of kites made by leading artists and kite makers touring the world and kite festivals around the world are multiplying at an astonishing rate. As a sport or a hobby kites have much in their favour. They are cheap quite easy to make and most importantly kites can teach the maker much about the physical world. ',Japan

' Here are a few things to help you get oriented. ',Japan
' Kyoto is roughly flanked by mountains to the east and west. The Kamo River runs north south through the center of the city. Osaka is about 60 km to the south. ',Japan
' The city was built on a rectangular grid system. The main streets running east to west are numbered in ascending order from north to south and are roughly 500 meters apart from each other  with smaller streets in between . This means Ni Jyou  2nd Avenue  is north of San Jyo  Third Avenue  and San Jyou is north of Shi Jyou  Fourth Avenue . The main north south street is Karasuma dori  Karasuma Avenue  which runs from Kyoto Station through the city center to the Imperial Palace. ',Japan
' Kyoto was originally modeled after the Chinese Tang dynasty  618 907  capital Chang an  now Xian . At some early point the western half of Kyoto came to be called Choan jo  Chang an Castle  and the eastern half Rakuyo jo  Castle of Luoyang another early Chinese capital . However the western half of Kyoto was full of wetlands and soon became desolate and the name Choan jo gained only nominal usage. On the other hand the development of eastern Kyoto made Rakuyo synonymous with the capital and the abbreviation Raku came to mean Kyoto itself. During the 14th century the Imperial Palace the center of the capital also moved over to the east where the current Imperial Palace of Kyoto is located today.

' The Farewell The gardens of the castle. Normanno the right hand retainer of the lord of the castle speaks of how he will restore the family s honour. Then Enrico lord of the castle lets slip that he wants to destroy his arch enemy Edgardo and have his sister Lucia enter into a tactical marriage with Lord Arturo but that Lucia will not consent. Lucia s instructor Raimondo explains that she is weeping thinking of her mother who has passed away  to which Normanno says She has a lover  and reveals that it is Enrico s arch enemy Edgardo. Enrico pales with anger and people inform him that Edgardo has appeared for a moment . Enrico s rage builds. Evening at the castle. Lucia waits in the garden for her lover. She says she has seen a ghost by the fountain thus frightening her handmaid Alisa. Edgardo appears and tells Lucia that he must make an urgent trip to France. This saddens Lucia but he asks her to pledge her undying love for him. The exchange rings and Lucia bids him farewell. ',Japan
' The Engagement Enrico s house. Normanno tells his lord that he has prepared a counterfeit letter as if from Edgardo stating that he has given his heart to another woman. Lucia appears. Her brother orders her to marry Arturo for the sake of the family but she replies that she has pledged her love to another. However she is shaken by reading the counterfeit letter and calls on divine help. Raimondo talks to Lucia and persuader her that her lover is unfaithful. A crowd awaits the bridegroom in the great hall of the palace. Arturo appears. Enrico goes to greet him and Lucia also appears attired as a bride. In a daze she signs the marriage covenant as ordered. At the moment Edgardo suddenly appears. Arturo and Enrico stand in his way but Raimondo comes between them and shows the marriage covenant.

'   Matsuo Basho 1689 ',Japan
' Strange by Western standards that premodern Japan s most famous traveler should have been a poet. The voyagers the West celebrates as explorers and discoverers were hard headed seamen rapacious adventurers high minded idealists   a mixed bag but poetry  ',Japan
' Their inspiration lay elsewhere   in ambition stronger than prudence in lusts deeper than fear. Fear of what  They hardly knew which made it doubly fearful. It took Prince Henry the Navigator s 15th century Portuguese sailors more than 60 years to inch their way down the unknown African coast   for said the mariners this much is clear that beyond  Morocco s Cape Bojador  there is no race of men nor place of inhabitants . . . while the currents are so terrible that no ships having once passed the Cape will ever be able to return . . .  So noted a contemporary chronicler. ',Japan
' Bartholomeu Dias who rounded the continent s southern tip in 1488 was driven by courage of course but also lest his courage fail him by a storm so terrible the crew gave themselves up for dead.  When the wind abated they found to their astonishment that the coast ran northeast. The Indian Ocean lay open before them vast and uncharted. Somewhere out there were the fabulous Indies including Cipangu  Japan   islands most fertile  Marco Polo had reported 200 years before in gold pearls and precious stones and they cover the temples and the royal residences with solid gold.  ',Japan
' The cozy little world of medieval Christendom three continents huddled around the Mediterranean with Paradise somewhere off to the east was about to explode. ',Japan
' On the 27th day of the third moon  of the second year of Genroku   May 16 1689 314 years ago this week   Basho  a pen name deriving from the basho banana plant by his cottage  set forth from Edo  Tokyo  on his most famous journey   a five month trek north to Hiraizumi in present day Iwate Prefecture then southwest down the Sea of Japan coast to Ogaki near Lake Biwa. He was 45 a veteran of the road with four poetic travel narratives already behind him. Oku no hosomichi  Narrow Road to the Deep North   in 1694 became the fifth. ',Japan
' In the first The Record of a Weather Exposed Skeleton  he describes his wanderlust  Following the example of the ancient priest who is said to have traveled thousands of miles caring naught for his provisions and attaining the state of sheer ecstasy under the pure beams of the moon I left my broken house on the River Sumida in August  1684  among the wails of the autumn wind.  ',Japan
' We gather from the title that he was not robust and his poem as he prepares to depart   Determined to fall  A weather exposed skeleton . . .    suggests awful perhaps fatal rigors lying ahead. The anticipated harvest was poetry   not gold spices slaves knowledge trade routes heathens converted to Christianity or new lands won for his sovereign to reign over. Poetry  Sheer ecstasy under the pure beams of the moon.  ',Japan
' Basho surely never heard of Columbus and his new continent or of Vasco da Gama who sailed round Africa and landed in India in 1498 or of Ferdinand Magellan who circumnavigated the globe in 1520 21. Basho s world in physical terms was far far narrower than even the pre Columbian Western world. ',Japan
' China  was Basho s symbol for anything in it that was not Japan. He had never set eyes on China never would didn t want to. Had not Chinese and Japanese poets of old already captured its magnificence in verse  He left for the Deep North dreaming of the moon over Matsushima   nor did Matsushima disappoint him when he finally arrived  Matsushima is indeed the most beautiful place in all Japan  It can easily hold its own with Lake Tung ting and Lake Xi in China.  ',Japan
' China meant more than dream scenery to Columbus and he had every intention of setting eyes on it. He envisioned a fabulous empire of gold jewels spices inconceivable flora and fauna possibly even the legendary Christian king known as Prester John reportedly eager to unite with Western Christians against the infidel. China is where Columbus thought he was going when he sailed westward from Spain in August 1492  it s where he thought he was two months later when a Cuban Indian  made a reference to a local region called Cubanacan  and Columbus took him to mean El Gran Can    the Great Khan of Marco Polo s China. Thinking they were being escorted to the khan s palace Columbus and his men arrived instead at a village of 50 palm thatched huts whose awed inhabitants received them as messengers from the sky. Basho would have been charmed. ',Japan
' Basho s Cuba    his America    was Japan s far northern provinces.  That was as remote as a Japanese could legally venture in his day and for nearly two centuries to come. The country had been sealed shut 60 years earlier by order of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The policy was called sakoku   literally closed country.  Venturing overseas   or having ventured returning   was a capital offense. ',Japan
' Might that not cramp a wandering poet s style  Not Basho s. Far from straining at the bit far from lusting for the great wide world from which his country s laws barred him Basho paused at the Tokugawa shrine at Nikko on his way north to pay fulsome homage to the most sacred of all shrines  whose  benevolent power prevails throughout the land embracing the entire people like the bright beams of the sun.  ',Japan
' Politics aside freedom is Basho s theme embodied in his very trajectory. Heading north writes Basho translator Nobuyuki Yuasa meant avoiding the familiar Tokaido route.  In the imagination of the people at least the North was largely unexplored and it represented for Basho all the mystery there was in the universe. ',Japan
' Symbolic gateway to this mystery  was the Shirakawa Barrier 180 km north of Edo in present day Fukushima Prefecture. An ancient defense against northern barbarians it was a mere ruin in Basho s day but as an utamakura a place with poetic associations it was very much alive. Had I a messenger I would send a missive to the capital   wrote the poet Taira Kanemori at Shirakawa in the 10th century by which time the barrier was already in disuse. The suggestion is of hopeless remoteness   but Basho unlike Kanemori was not ending his journey here. He was beginning it. ',Japan
' The West had its own version of sakoku. Scholars call it the Great Interruption    a 1000 year attempt reinforced by all the supernatural terrors of the primitive Christian imagination to squeeze the world into a shape consistent with Holy Writ. Jerusalem was the navel of the world.  Six parts hast thou dried up  declared the apocryphal Book of Esdras   six parts of seven that is  oceans hardly came into the picture at all. When they did they led to the void or to Paradise. ',Japan
' St. Brendan  484 578  sailed westward from Ireland to Paradise. So he said on his return and he was believed. His sacred island  writes historian Daniel Boorstin remained plainly marked on maps for more than 1000 years at least until 1759.  Christopher Columbus the discoverer of America made four voyages to his new continent without realizing that it was one. He thought it was Asia. But the puzzles and inconsistencies multiplied. His journals show him suspecting the truth  I believe this is a very great continent until today unknown   then veering away from it  I am convinced it is the spot of the earthly paradise wither no one can go but by God s permission . . .  The great discoverer died in 1506 unenlightened by his discoveries. ',Japan
' By Basho s time of course most of the confusion had been sorted out. America was settled and thriving  the institutions and the thinking that were to produce the American Revolution were well under way. Europe s fleets plied the oceans its commerce spanned the globe. Even closed Cipangu had given the Dutch a foothold at Nagasaki. The new world vast beyond medieval imaginings was slowly growing familiar. ',Japan
' Basho meanwhile plodded north. A famous contemporary portrait shows him in priestly garb leaning on a stick his feet shod in thin sandals his disciple Sora following behind. He traveled mostly on foot occasionally on horseback a prematurely elderly man feeble and frequently ill braving the rigors of the road in pursuit of the moon over Matsushima.  ',Japan
' Whatever such a mind sees is a flower  he had written earlier   such a mind  meaning a mind in harmony with nature   and whatever such a mind dreams of is the moon.  In Basho the stars pass almost unnoticed. ',Japan
' Did he know of the newly discovered shape and extent of the world  There is no indication he did or that he cared about such things. Other matters preoccupied him the smaller and quieter the better. ',Japan
' Born Matsuo Kinsaku in 1644 in the castle town of Ueno near Kyoto he studied poetry as a child and as a young man cast off his samurai status to enter a temple. He moved to Edo became a teacher of poetry grew increasingly restless with social and poetic conventions and drifted away from both moving into a quasi hermitage on the Sumida River and slowly over the years refining haiku from a facile social pastime into an art mirroring our everlasting self which is poetry.  ',Japan
' What is the matter you Christian men that you so greatly esteeme so little portion of gold more than your own quietnesse . . .  So the 16th century chronicler Peter Martyr records a young Indian reproaching a party of Spaniards quarreling over gold. A pity Basho never encountered these Indians. He would have liked them   and they him. Since I had nowhere permanent to stay  he wrote I had no interest whatever in keeping treasures and since I was empty handed I had no fear of being robbed on the way.  ',Japan
' As for quietnesse  that was Basho s special discovery and he gave it a significance beyond mere absence of noise  ',Japan
' Stillness   the cicada s chirp seeps into the rocks.  ',Japan
' He trudged miles for months through primitive country in poor health   seeking no reward beyond stillness.  It must have been a marvelous stillness indeed purchased at so high a cost. ',Japan
' Among the squabbling Spaniards was one Vasco Nunez de Balboa. The Indian in Peter Martyr s report continues  I will shewe you a region flowing with golde where you may satisfie your ravening appetites . . . When you are passing over these mountains . . . you will see another sea . . .  Following the Indian s directions Balboa and his party hacked their way across the Isthmus of Panama passing through inaccessible defiles inhabited by ferocious beasts . . . risking poisonous snakes and the arrows of unknown tribes.  On Sept. 25 1513 they became the first Europeans to behold the Pacific Ocean. Kneeling upon the ground  Balboa  raised his hands to heaven and saluted the . . . sea  according to his account he gave thanks to God and all the saints for having reserved this glory for him an ordinary man . . .  ',Japan
' Basho immortalized lesser glory. From Yamagata where he encountered the cicada he trekked on to the Mogami River. The river was swollen with rain making the boat journey perilous.  Of such scenes is haiku made. ',Japan
' Gathering the rains of the wet season   swift the Mogami River.  ',Japan

' MOTOBU OKINAWA PREF.   As Okinawa s Route 58 snakes northwards leaving behind the lines of silver razor wire that surround the perimeters of U.S. military bases the shabby ribbon of towns that form a kind of urban bricolage is replaced with farmland and salty breezes from the East China Sea. ',Japan
' Nago is the first settlement of consequence in this region of northern Okinawa. An appealingly laconic town with stained concrete buildings sun blistered wooden homes and little comestible stores it reminds me of the dusty towns along the Mekong River in northern Thailand. The improbable decision to choose Nago to host the Group of Eight summit in 2000 briefly put the area on the map. It has since dropped off. ',Japan
' My purpose for being here is to visit its city hall designed by a daring group of young architects who were also the founders in 1971 of a collective known as Team Zoo. The group was commissioned to create a building that departed from tradition in a town where in ancient times building styles were based on Chinese models. ',Japan
' Completed in 1981 the town hall reflects the region s languid semitropical environs with airy open corridors and staircases wide patios and shaded breezeways bedizened with pots of pink and magenta bougainvillea. The exterior columns a latticework of concrete pillars and supports are covered in bands of pink and gray like a barber s pole. The open design has shaped a building that does not despite its function seem in the least bit institutional. ',Japan
' Critic Patrice Goulet once commented that Team Zoo s projects though patently unconventional in drawing their ideas from the vernacular culture could appear so normal to some so traditional even   so vulgar to others.  Affectionately eccentric one might add like the 56 talismanic Okinawa shisa statues  lion esque guardians of Okinawa homes  that are tacked to the outside of the building perched on concrete plinths like gargoyles. ',Japan
' At the rear of Unten Port to the northeast of the peninsula Mumujana baka rarely appears on maps. Over half a millennium old   but unlisted as a heritage site   its tombs carved into the rock face and containing the remains of regents who once served the Ryukyu Kingdom have remained outside the mainstream of time. Neither Buddhist nor Shinto with ties closer to ancient forms of animism Okinawans have long practiced a polytheistic form of religion   largely presided over by female priestesses and shamans   that concerns itself more with ritual than complex cosmological musings. ',Japan
' Somebody had left a clutch of cane walking sticks at the entrance to the tombs placed there not to support the weary but to thwack the tropical growth on either side of the earthen path to send snakes slithering away. My experience of habu Okinawa s most venomous pit viper creatures that infest limestone cliffs like this is that they are not so easily intimidated. ',Japan
' Traditionally the floors of homes in this and other rural areas were cleansed with salt water a measure aimed at preventing snakes and cockroaches from entering. Luckily the only reptile I come across is the harmless Ryukyu kinobori tokage an alert green skinned Okinawa tree lizard. The region s ibo imori newt mountain turtles and the flightless rail keep themselves out of sight concealed in jungle camouflage though almost supernaturally large black and white  gomadara  tree nymph  butterflies flutter above the path. ',Japan
' Roads deeper into the peninsula rise into more forest one unsurfaced lane ending at the grassy forecourt of Ai Kaze an aizome  indigo dye  workshop whose name translates to Indigo Wind.  I had visited before and had been surprised to see textile maker Masanao Shiroma pour a bottle of awamori Okinawa s signature liquor into the dyeing vat a means it was explained to fasten the blue into the material before it is wind dried on a line outside. This repeat visit is spurred by the memory of its cafe where a strong local brew is served at handmade wooden tables and chairs on a deck that is cantilevered over the garden and surrounding forest. ',Japan
' Nearby Nakijin is an attractive village its midday torpor inductive to either eating or for those so inclined sleeping. Erected on an isolated eminence its northern parts facing the ocean and with a precipitous drop along its eastern edge into a gorge the site for Nakijin Castle was surely chosen not merely for its defensive features but also for drama. ',Japan
' The masonry here is cruder than the limestone work seen in castles in southern Okinawa but the site lines that now constitute its main walls and the remains of an ancient keep hint at well developed engineering skills. The foundations of residences used by retainers a garden area and fresh spring form a well managed enclosure. There are also visible traces of prayer sites once used by priestesses to conduct prayers and rituals. ',Japan
' Following Route 115 in a southerly direction connecting with Route 84 the main coastal road leads to what is without question the peninsula s main draw  the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium. Tanks and outdoor pools form a veritable marine kingdom of reef manta rays  flame snappers  graceful bull tiger and whale sharks  manatee  luminescent shrimp  and some of the most bizarre looking fish you will ever set eyes on. The whale sharks magnificent in their command of the water float in territorial splendor through the depths of the aquarium s humongous main tank whose acrylic front panel was once the largest in the world. ',Japan
' It s just a few minutes north from the aquarium to Bise a coastal village known for its sandy lanes lined with dense fukugi  evergreen  trees. Even on sunny days only filtered light makes it through the canopy of closely matted leaves  the trees are used throughout Okinawa as typhoon barriers. Snugly inside their arboreal quadrangles are traditional Okinawa houses crafted from stone tile and wood. Some 230 homes sit within an aural oasis where the buzz of cicadas rustle of leaves and the lap of the ocean are the sole sounds. ',Japan
' Few people visit the nearby village of Shinzato with its attractive but modest residencies and kitchen gardens. The evident lack of a center to the settlement made finding the new home of the highly regarded potter Paul Lorimer a trying business. When Lorimer who has lived in Okinawa for over 40 years went to view the property there was little to see the long abandoned structure covered in jungle vines. ',Japan
' Then his first task was to dig out a termite nest from one of the rooms. It s a very different residence today with polished floors antique cabinets a gallery where he exhibits his earthy stoneware jars vases plates incense burners and flagons and a long garden facing deck hand built like the brick kiln at the rear of the property by Lorimer himself. ',Japan
' Much of his work involves producing unglazed storage jars for awamori an Okinawa liquor made from indica rice imported from Thailand. A good deal of floor space in Lorimer s main room is taken up with rows of liquor casks and the native New Zealander turns out to be quite a specialist on the subject. ',Japan
' Intrigued by the reaction that takes place between aging awamori and the chemical elements of clay jars   such as manganese calcium and magnesium   and their effect on taste depth and aroma Lorimer has placed the liquor into containers of differing mineral characters in what is an ongoing experiment. Lorimer steers me through a range of older liquors to demonstrate the difference  Clay matured awamori in contrast to younger bottled varieties has the effect of mollifying and teasing the palate rather than biting into it. ',Japan
' Lorimer s lifestyle and work and the material environs he has created to compliment them suggest at least to the casual guest an earthly Utopia. How many of us spellbound by the transcendent naturalism that is a feature of Henry David Thoreau s book Walden  or poet Janet Frame s account of her stay in the once Elysium like Balearic Islands have dreamed of withdrawing to a rural idyll like this  Such are the thoughts occupying me as I drive back to my minshuku  guest house  reaching the west coast of the peninsula as twilight fades. ',Japan
' Darkness swallows up the sun but not the heat or the unholy downpour that soaks me to the skin. The clouds above are pierced by bolts of lightning and the ocean is lit up to phantasmagoric effect. As the thunder recedes the lashing rain turns to sputtering squalls. The storm is spent. ',Japan
' There are regular buses from Okinawa s Naha Bus Terminal to the city of Nago. The bus service around the Motobu Peninsula is patchy and buses infrequent. To fully experience the area it is better to rent a car or scooter. ',Japan

' The times were out of joint. The land of the gods  had been violated. Foreigners strode the sacred soil. The shogun in Edo  present day Tokyo  was helpless. Ten years had passed since American Black Ships  steamed into Edo Bay   demanding trade brandishing ultimatums dictating treaties. The shogun signed. He opened ports to foreign trade exempted foreigners from Japanese law. Was this not treason  ',Japan
' Medieval shoguns centuries earlier had seized power from Japan s legitimate ruler the divine emperor. The gods had long contained their anger. Now at last they were stirring. Yamatodamashii  Japanese spirit  flared in righteous Japanese breasts. Traitors   living and dead   must be cut down. ',Japan
' The 14th century Toji Temple was founded by shogun Ashikaga Takauji  1305 58 . A brilliant warrior and vigorous ruler he charted a new course for Japan. The Ashikaga Period that Takauji initiated  1336 1573 also known as the Muromachi Period  spawned arts commerce and diplomacy that permanently raised the level of Japanese culture. Noh drama tea ceremony deeper Zen wider trade with China the Temple of the Golden Pavilion the Temple of the Silver Pavilion   such in part is the Ashikaga legacy. ',Japan
' The nine swordsmen cared little for that. Other thoughts consumed them  Takauji s treacherous seizure of power from the emperor he d originally been enlisted to serve  his grandson Yoshimitsu s humiliating kowtowing to China for trade and the China conferred title King of Japan    wounds to the sacred body politic still throbbing half a millennium later in the souls of those who regarded themselves as the emperor s most fervent loyalists. ',Japan
' The statues of Takauji Yoshimitsu  1358 1408  and Ashikaga Yoshiakira  1330 67  were of wood. The zealots yanked off the three heads and took them to the bank of the Kamo River for public display   an encouragement to loyalists a warning to latter day traitors. A placard explained These three traitors having done the worst evil their vile statues have been visited with the vengeance of heaven.  ',Japan
' For 250 years Japan had been a closed country.  Foreigners were barbarians.  Foreign ideas were subversive. Foreign intentions were rapacious   look at China corrupted and dismembered by foreign aggressors. Foreigners and foreignness would not penetrate Japan. Its rulers would see to it. ',Japan
' But the Tokugawa shoguns  1603 1868  could not see to it. Russia Britain and the United States were expansionist powers hungry for trade if not conquest. Early exploratory incursions in the late 18th century exposed the weakness of Japan s coastal defenses. Barbarian guns would have their way. The Black Ships  appearance at Edo Bay in 1853 settled the issue  Japan was open. ',Japan
' Subversive currents of thought had long damned the Tokugawas as usurpers   traitors. Japan s true rulers were gods not men. The shogun ruling in Edo while the emperor languished impotently in Kyoto was sacrilege. Now the gods were reclaiming their own the foreigners their instruments. The rallying cry was Sonn  j i     Revere the emperor expel the barbarians   Unruly rioters and deadly swordsmen converged on Kyoto. Shogunal officials were cut down in broad daylight. It was chaos. ',Japan
' In the thick of things though hardly at the forefront was a remarkable woman a peasant poetess who burned with fervor to serve Japan s gods and emperor. She could not wield a sword and lamented her weak body of a useless woman.  She would wield her poetry instead. ',Japan
' Matsuo Taseko was born in 1811 in a village in the Ina Valley in today s Nagano Prefecture. The local economy was thriving. Historian Anne Walthall in The Weak Body of a Useless Woman  Matsuo Taseko and the Meiji Restoration  speaks of a rural industrious revolution  harbinger of the urban industrial one to come. Cottage industry not yet evolved into factory industry was slowly raising living standards. Taseko s father was a village headman and an entrepreneur. Farming aside he ran a ferry boat concession brewed and sold sake and lent money. He was literate and had a home library. Often he had to shoo his daughter out of it and back to her chores. She wasn t lazy   far from it   but bookishness is a passion not to be denied. If necessary she d skip meals to read. Female literacy at this time is estimated at 10 . Taseko was a very exceptional child indeed. ',Japan
' Nothing might have come of it. Peasant life could have consumed her. She married at 18 had 10 children labored in the fields raised silkworms   and wrote poetry. It was poetry that led her at age 51 to part from her family and travel mostly on foot to Kyoto on fire with nationalist ferment. She soared on wings she hadn t known she had  The scent of the plum   that perfumes the awesome reaches above the clouds  i.e. the imperial palace    now clings to the sleeve   of this base born commoner.  ',Japan
' Poetry and peasantry seem an odd coupling. Not so Walthall explains. Itinerant poets roamed the countryside. They found eager pupils. Poetry and politics merged. Taseko s teacher one Iwasaki Nagayo oriented her toward loyalism. He himself was a disciple of the nationalist thinker Hirata Atsutane  1776 1843  who d written This our glorious land is the land in which the gods have their origin and we are one and all the descendants of the gods.  ',Japan
' A poetry revolution preceded the political one. Both were restorations    politically of imperial rule poetically of verse forms harking back to pure Japanese Shinto simplicity unsullied by Buddhist and Confucian thought from China. Taseko under Nagayo s guidance reoriented her poetry accordingly. From now on  she wrote in 1861 I will follow the way of the gods.  ',Japan
' The following year she set out for Kyoto to add her poetry to the gathering storm. Caught at the mercy of the autumn winds  she wrote I resolved to visit the capital to fulfill my dreams.  ',Japan

' If woodblock prints are to be believed the metropolis was once awash in greens and blues. Reedy riverbanks grassy hillocks and marshes draped with willows all feature in One Hundred Famous Views of Edo  the 19th century series of woodblock prints of the capital  then called Edo  by master artist Utagawa Hiroshige. Above all are the waterways wide rivers and narrow canals colored a deep Prussian blue crisscrossed by gently arching wooden bridges. Boats   cargo boats piled high with barrels and steered by stooped men in sampans  pleasure boats their blinds drawn on the courtesans and patrons within   make their way up and down these causeways. One hundred and fifty years ago Tokyo at least from the right angles looked downright romantic. So the question is  What happened  ',Japan
' I m standing with Norihisa Minagawa at the entrance to a sh tengai a shopping street the likes of which can be found in neighborhoods all over Japan. This one happens to be in the Wakaba district of Shinjuku Ward. Like most sh tengai it contains the smallest of small businesses including a broom closet sized electronics store manned by an elderly man wearing a baseball cap and watching television. The street is narrow and oddly crooked. With its faded signs it looks inconsequential. But it isn t  it s a clue. Stick with me we re going for a walk. ',Japan
' Minagawa is an architect by trade. He is also the founder along with his colleague Hajime Ishikawa of the amusingly named Suribachi Gakkai  Mortar Society  a loose collective of amateur historians and machi aruki  city walking  enthusiasts. They re part of a long tradition of urban explorers that in Japan would include anyone from the sentimental early 20th century novelist Nagai Kafu to the scholar Hidenobu Jinnai author of the excellent Tokyo  A Spatial Anthology  to the Street Observation Studies Society of the 1980s whose particular mania were the uncanny oddities that Tokyo is apt at producing  decorative stairways to nowhere for example . For them and for Minagawa walking is the key to understanding Tokyo it s particular Tokyo ness and how it got to be that way. ',Japan
' People know that there are a lot of hills  in Tokyo . But people don t really walk they take the subway. So you come out of the subway and you don t know what s beyond the hill. But if you walk around on the surface you can really see the unevenness  Minagawa says. ',Japan
' Suribachi Gakkai s singular focus is Tokyo s natural topography. With a far from ironic seriousness they spend weekend afternoons charting the city s hills and valleys. It s an endeavor that involves some serious legwork as Tokyo which I have quickly come to understand has a lot of literal ups and downs. ',Japan
' Geographically Tokyo is often divided into shitamachi the lowlands of the east side of the city and yamanote the highlands to the west. Historically during the feudal Edo Period  1603 1868  yamanote was the district where the lords had their villas. Meanwhile shitamachi was the district of the common people. If you look at a topographical map of Tokyo you can see that the divide falls on a fairly straight line drawn from Ueno to Meguro where the Musashino Plateau gives way to the Sumida River delta. The Imperial Palace on the grounds of what used to be Edo Castle sits just on the edge of the highlands with a commanding view over the lowlands and Tokyo Bay. ',Japan
' Yet a closer look at the topography of the yamanote turns up a more complicated picture  The yamanote itself is perforated by rivers that run toward the bay and rivulets that end in swamps and pools. The result is an undulating unevenness a series of hills and valleys. It s a topography that sets Tokyo apart from other Japanese cities and most cities in general. ',Japan
' Tokyo is surrounded by volcanoes like Mount Fuji and Mount Hakone  the Gunma native says. When they erupted in the past they spread ash all over the region and as a result Tokyo s topsoil comprises about 20 meters deep of ash. When you combine this with the East Asian monsoons   Tokyo gets a lot of rain   you get these depressions. It s strange  the highlands are flat and then there are all these valleys that look like they ve been carved out with a spoon.  ',Japan
' Minagawa also likens these valleys to the divots on a grinding stone as if some ancient race of giants had once used the Musashino Plateau to grind their flour   hence the name Mortar Society.  ',Japan
' The day I meet Minagawa he is leading a group of 20 or so members of the NHK culture club   a sprawling organization that offers courses and seminars on diverse themes   around the eastern side of Shinjuku Ward from Shinanomachi Station to Akebonobashi Station. ',Japan
' This wasn t an official outing of the Suribachi Gakkai more like a lesson for the uninitiated on reading Tokyo like a palimpsest.  Or a neighborhood stroll with that friend who knows all the best detours and the stories they hold . Minagawa hands out photocopies of maps of our route one each from the Edo Meiji  1868 1912  and present eras. ',Japan
' Looking very much the student of the streets that he is   wearing jeans a windbreaker and sneakers and carrying a canvas satchel bag   Minagawa sets a quick pace. He leads the group southeast along Gaien Higashi Boulevard which runs along the forested grounds of the Meiji Gaien complex with its sports stadiums and halls. This is followed by an abrupt hairpin turn to the left and a steep descent. Unlike the broad regal sweep of the boulevard which was now several meters above our heads the roads in the valley below are narrow and tightly woven. We d left behind establishment Tokyo for a residential quarter a warren of two story wood framed homes awash in potted plants and airing laundry. ',Japan
' Tokyo seems to be this city of new buildings but in these valleys there are buildings that have been there since I was a child. I feel at home  says Minagawa who was born in 1963. ',Japan
' One thing about Tokyo that is interesting is that the natural topography remains. Tokyo became a city in the Edo Period about 400 years ago. Back then there were no bulldozers  everything was done by manpower  he says. Now the valleys would just be filled in the landscape would be changed. But 400 years ago the city had to be built to fit the topography. And such development remains today.  ',Japan
' So while the feudal lords built their villas high on the hills of the yamanote ordinary people filled in the river valleys in between. It was a natural arrangement  the run off from the rivers created ideal conditions for paddy farming. This explains why you can find pockets of what look like quintessential shitamachi   the two story wooden houses and narrow shopping streets   on the yamanote side of town. ',Japan
' The bones of the city were set in the Edo Period  Minagawa says. What used to be a feudal villa now still belongs to the kachi gumi society s winners  the government embassies universities and hospitals. The area with fields has always been for the ordinary people.  ',Japan
' We wind our way past a park Wakaba koen one of Tokyo s many sad asphalt slabs with just a smattering of benches and a plastic slide. According to Minagawa a park in Tokyo usually means one of two things. If it is a landscaped park with a pond  such as Arisugawa Park in Hiroo  it was likely once part of a feudal era villa.  Ponds it seems were a must for any lord worthy of his preferential plot of land . If it s paved like this one it was probably once a swamp. ',Japan
' Eventually we reach that sh tengai. ',Japan
' This used to be a river  Minagawa says pointing to the street s curiously meandering path. ',Japan
' Or rather it likely still is a river   one that now flows underground. During the heady days of postwar reconstruction leading up to the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics many of the city s waterways were diverted underground and their paths paved over. In 1960s Tokyo there was nothing so romantic as progress. ',Japan
' Lots of foreign visitors were expected for the Olympics. The rivers back then were dirty full of sewage so not good from a sanitation perspective  Minagawa says. Also they stank.  ',Japan
' So this is what happened to the rivers all but invisible unless you know what to look for  a winding street faint echoes of running water under a storm drain and addresses that include kawa the Japanese word for river. ',Japan
' If you imagine that the road you are walking on used to be a river that s kind of exciting right   Minagawa asks. ',Japan
' Yet how many Tokyoites are aware of the rivers they cross every day   A quick survey of friends suggests not so many.  The Wakaba sh tengai is but one example and many other sh tengai were also once rivers. Shibuya s main drag Center Gai and Harajuku s Cat Street are other examples. The rivers that run under each the Uda River and the Shibuya River converge under Shibuya s famous scramble crossing. It makes sense when you think about it  whenever heavy rain falls on the capital domestic TV stations send their camera crews to Shibuya for footage of taxis sloshing through flooded streets. ',Japan
' What is perhaps most fascinating about this secret underground life of the city is that it still seems to be just that   a secret. And in just a generation or two the collective memory of the city will be erased. What defining elements of Tokyo will be completely forgotten in 50 years  ',Japan
' As much as Tokyo is a city of hills and valleys it is also a city of progress and engineering. The poor Edo era souls who dug the Kanda aqueduct the deep gash that you see when you take the Chuo Line past Ochanomizu may not have had bulldozers but they dug it just the same. And bulldozers eventually came anyway. So did concrete which settled over the city like another layer of ash. Increasingly it s not just the rivers but whole valleys that are getting paved over  Roppongi Hills is the classic example of a divot  that has recently been filled in. From a land distribution point of view it s a waste to have these small houses in the middle of Tokyo. Minato Ward is the liveliest area in Tokyo so it is naturally attractive to developers. In the place of a two story building you could put up a 10 story or 20 story one  says Minagawa who tries hard to be an objective observer though he admits he doesn t always succeed. ',Japan
' I hope at least some of these places with a real sense of Tokyo   a sense of history   will remain and not become just more of the same developments that could be  located  anywhere  he says. ',Japan
' Our end goal is Arakicho a particularly mazelike district stretching between Yotsuya Sanchome Station and Akebonobashi Station. Here the alleyways are paved in stone and crosshatched with telephone lines. On either side there are low rise buildings housing tiny eight seater bars and restaurants. The look is of Tokyo 50 years past. It s perfectly representative of those pockets of the old city wedged among the new. Arakicho once a Meiji Era pleasure district and now a fashionable place to eat and drink is also representative of Tokyoites  mixed feelings about the drumbeat of development. During the day it s a ghost town save for the odd bar proprietress in plastic slippers watering her plants. Come evening however when the backlit signs and paper lanterns glow and there is the click of heels on stone   ',Japan

' Jul. 3 2018 Updated Introduction to Polarization observation and Near Ultraviolet observation by SGLI ',Japan
' The Second Generation Global Imager  SGLI  instrument aboard the JAXA satellite Global Change Observation Mission Climate  GCOM C  is an optical sensor capable of observations at wavelengths ranging from near ultraviolet to thermal infrared  380nm to 12 m . SGLI can observe the polarization state of light in red and near infrared band by switching to directional angles from  45deg  forward  and  45deg  backward . Polarization measurement can provide the properties of light including the oscillation direction of electromagnetic waves in addition to the magnitude of light. ',Japan
' Polarization observation and near ultraviolet  380nm  observation by SGLI expected to characterize aerosols  fine particles in atmosphere  on Earth s land surface more accurately. In the visible near infrared spectra the surface reflectance is high over land. Vegetation and land cover affect the space based measurement resulting in varied readings. Identifying types of aerosol over land only at these wavelengths is therefore hampered by difficulties. ',Japan
' However in the SGLI ultraviolet wavelength regions the reflectance of the Earth s land is significantly lower. In addition polarization observation is less susceptible to the reflection of sunlight from Earth s surface compared with unpolarization observation. These features are expected to improve the accuracy of the measurement for aerosols over land by enabling to detect the properties of the fine particles of the atmosphere. ',Japan

' Oct. 18 2017 Updated Detection of intact lunar lava tubes in the data from Kaguya radar sounding ',Japan
' The international research team investigated the analysis of the SELENE Lunar Radar Sounder  LRS  data and confirmed that multiple lunar lava tubes exist extending a few to several tens of meters in depth underneath the volcanic region. One floor of the holes extended several tens of kilometers westward of the east end of the lava tube that LRS detected. The results from the LRS data analysis are valuable from science and future exploration perspectives as they offer evidence for the existence of previously hypothesized subsurface lava tubes. Since the insides of lunar lava tubes are believed to be in pristine state careful study of the interior provides insight regarding the evolutionary history of the Moon. Intact lava tubes shielded from the hostile outside environment offer potential sites for lunar base construction. Though lava tube caves can be buried beneath the holes few such holes have been discovered. This suggests that underground void is limited which can accommodate the lunar base for science and exploration.

' Data from JAXA s Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki reports the evidence of a fast atmospheric flow near the planet s equator. ',Japan
' JAXA and the team of researchers from the Hokkaido University and others used images from the Akatsuki orbiter to track jet  shaping strong winds in the low and middle cloud region which extends from 45 to 60 kilometers in altitude. The wind speed maximized near the equator. They named this phenomenon Venusian equatorial jet. ',Japan
' Previously the wind speed at this altitude was thought to be uniform 2 presenting little zonal and temporal variabilities. However the findings seem to contradict the hypothesis and suggest that unexpected variability exists deep in the cloud layer. ',Japan
' Venus  whole atmosphere is rotating much faster than the surface below at the altitude of the cloud top  70 km  a unique situation called superrotation. Its mechanism is still largely unclear.

' Jan. 25 2017 Updated Is there little metallic iron in the universe  ',Japan
' Solid particles containing iron  dust particles  act to promote the formation of molecules in interstellar space and are key to understanding physical and chemical processes there. Iron contained in dust particles comes in various forms such as metallic iron and iron oxide each with different properties. Previous studies have suggested that iron is present mainly in forms other than iron oxide iron carbide and iron sulfide. To verify the possibility that metallic iron is present a research team led by Dr. Kimura  Hokkaido University  performed in situ observations of gaseous iron cooling in a microgravity environment and investigated the ease of iron aggregation  the efficiency at which metallic iron forms . The experimental results showed that unlike in the results of ground experiments it was difficult for iron atoms to aggregate. In other words it is difficult for metallic iron to form in outer space. The team speculates that iron in dust particles is not a metal but rather contained as a compound or adhered to other particles as an impurity. The results of this research were published in the online journal Science Advances of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on 21 January 2017. ',Japan

' In December 2015 the longwave infrared  LIR  camera mounted on the Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki discovered a bow shaped feature stretching about 10000 km in a north south direction. This pattern remained in nearly the same place over the observation period of four days without being affected by the easterly wind  super rotation  in the Venus atmosphere. Examination using numerical simulations suggested that turbulence in the lower atmosphere generates waves that propagate through the atmosphere. The waves propagate north and south through the sky creating a bow like temperature distribution passing through the upper end of clouds at an altitude of about 65 km. This study showed that the state of Venus  lower atmosphere can be inferred from observations of its cloud tops.

' An international team observed the hot gas in the Perseus cluster with the Soft X ray Spectrometer  SXS  on board the X ray Astronomy Satellite ASTRO H  Hitomi  during its initial operation phase which started one week after liftoff. The total integration time was 230000 s. The energy resolution of the SXS data was high equaling the best resolution estimated during ground testing. The observation data demonstrated the good in orbit performance of the SXS and its ability to measure the velocity of hot gas with at least 20 times better resolution than previous instruments. This observation resulted in the first determination of the velocity of hot gas in the center of a galaxy cluster. At the center of the Perseus cluster a gigantic black hole emits powerful jets that collide with the surrounding hot gas and push it outward. For this reason large turbulent flows of the hot gas were expected. However the SXS observation revealed that the chaotic motion was small and the hot gas was calm despite the violent conditions. These results are presented in a paper published on July 7 2016 in the journal Nature. ',Japan

' Mar. 27 2015 Updated Galaxy Scale Outflow of Matter Stimulated by a Monster Black hole ',Japan
' By the observations from the Japan led Suzaku X ray satellite adn the European Space Agency s infrared Herschel Space Observatory scientists have discovered the first proof that a fierce outward wind  is produced when a huge black hole consumes a large mass of material and the wind is source of outflow of matter at the galaxy scale. Detail analysis of spectral data acquired from Suzaku s on board CCD camera found that active galactic nucleus are blown out from near edge of a center huge black hole every year at equivalent of 1.5 solar mass and at about 30  of light speed. They further describe that the black hole s activity is responsible for blowing star forming gas out of the galaxy s central regions. When the black hole shines at its brightest the researchers say it s also effectively clearing gas and dust from the galaxy s central regions and shutting down star formation there. The scientists think the observed galaxy known as IRAS F11119 3257 represents an early phase in the evolution of a quasar a type of black hole powered galaxy with extreme luminosity across a broad wavelength range. This research outcome indicates that the black hole s activity in galactic center is a key to understand the evolution of the host galaxy.

The sensor part of the SGD does not activate till the temperature hits a low temperature of minus 20 degrees  C . However the SGDs will be installed outside of the satellite panel thus their temperature will increase from radiation from the Sun and the Earth thermal input from the satellite panel and heat from a large amount of LSI  large scale integrated circuits  and an amplifier if nothing is done. Therefore the accumulating heat will be carried to the radiator through thermal transfer and a heat pipe to be released and the SGD will be covered by the multi layer insulation  MLI  which looks like a bunch of aluminum foils to shut out heat input. The semiconductor sensor is also activated with high voltage of 200 to 1000 V hence it should also be tested if it would discharge in vacuum. Photo  The SGD 2 sits in the 8 meter chamber. ',Japan

In November 2011 orbit control operation at perihelion was performed three times using the RCS for the future rendezvous with Venus and the orbit has been shifted as planned. The AKATSUKI is now flying on an orbit where it can meet with Venus in 2015   . The satellite has to be exposed to the extremely harsh thermal environment every time it passes through the perihelion until it is injected into the Venus orbit  therefore we are operating the AKATSUKI with great care to maintain its condition. ',Japan
?,Japan
' It is desirable to inject the satellite into the Venus orbit in 2016 from a scientific observation point of view because we can put the satellite in an orbit that is closer to the equator in 2016. However as we take the satellite s operational challenges after its design life into consideration we keep comparing the insertion in 2015 and that in 2016 to finalize our plan in order to maximize our observation achievements while monitoring the satellite s status. ',Japan
' Dec. 21 2011 Updated ASTRO G project suspension ',Japan
' JAXA decided to suspend the Radio Astronomical Satellite ASTRO G project because we found a technological difficulty for a high precision 9 meter deployment antenna which is the key device for observations. The satellite has been developed to achieve high resolution astronomical observations. The currently available antenna specular accuracy does not allow us to gain the most important scientific results. Also even if we downgrade our scientific target to an attainable range it became clear that we require far more time and money than for the original plan. Considering all the above conditions we have decided to halt the project. ',Japan
' Oct. 20 2011 Updated Last thank you message to DAICHI from Japan Coast Guard ',Japan
' The land observing satellite DAICHI which completed its operations in May 2011 had contributed to the Japan Coast Guard  JCG  by providing satellite images of ocean ice for a long time. On Oct. 18 the JCG sent a laser beam as a last message directly to the DAICHI from its Shimosato hydrographic observatory where they conduct satellite laser ranging. By doing so they would like to show their appreciation to the satellite. The observatory then received a reflection signal from the DAICHI s reflection prism to confirm that thebeam reached the satellite. The DAICHI must be very pleased to accept the JCG s gratitude. ',Japan
' Jul. 11 2011 Updated GCOM C1 structural model sinusoidal vibration test ',Japan
' JAXA conducted a sinusoidal vibration test for the GCOM C1 using a structural model. This test using simulated vibrations verifies if the satellite s structure and onboard equipment can bear sinusoidal vibrations which are generated at the time of launch. The test was successful and we confirmed that the satellite is strong enough. The structural model is a mechanically mocked satellite for verifying the tolerance of the satellite s main body and onboard equipment not only against sinusoidal vibrations at the time of launch but also against other factors including the acoustic environment shock at the time of separation from the launch vehicle and impact of the solar array paddle deployment.

' May 26 2011 Updated AJISAI received the Tsuboi Prize of the Geodetic Society of Japan  Group Prize  ',Japan
' The 25 year operation and precious observation data of the Experimental Geodetic Satellite AJISAI  EGS  was highly evaluated by the Geodetic Society of Japan and on May 23 2011 the Tsuboi Prize  Group Prize  was awarded to a group led by former space verification team project manager Eiichi Hashimoto. The group consists of JAXA the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology  NICT  the Japan Coast Guard  JCG  Geospatial Information Authority of Japan  GSI  and Hitotsubashi University. The AJISAI was launched on August 13 1986 to establish the Japan s geodetic datum.

' HONG KONG   Just eight months ago Chinese President Xi Jinping was snapping selfies with soccer stars in Manchester dining at Buckingham Palace and drinking beer in an English pub. ',Japan
' Queen Elizabeth hailed Xi s U.K. visit as a defining moment.  Xi and Prime Minister David Cameron heralded in a golden era  of relations establishing the U.K. as China s best partner in the West.  Xi quoted Shakespeare and stressed Britain s positive role  in deepening China s ties with the European Union. ',Japan
' Now Cameron is on the way out Britain has voted to exit the EU and Xi s being forced to reassess his strategy for the 28 member bloc China s second biggest trading partner according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ',Japan
' The U.K. has been a key advocate for China in Europe from building trade and financial links to supporting initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Beijing s leaders were counting on the U.K. s backing later this year when the bloc decides whether to grant China market economy status. ',Japan
' One major reason why China attaches great importance to its relations with the U.K. is to leverage EU policy via the U.K.  said Xie Tao a professor of political science at Beijing Foreign Studies University. London s value as a bridgehead  to Europe has been lost with Brexit Xie said leaving China to turn its focus to Germany. ',Japan
' Moreover Thursday s referendum introduced new uncertainty to the global status quo shocking financial markets and adding new pressure on China s slowing economy. Avoiding a hard landing is central to maintaining the Communist Party s own reputation as sound economic stewards. ',Japan
' Premier Li Keqiang the highest ranking Chinese leader to comment on the vote on Monday said the decision had further increased the uncertainty in the global economy.  We would like to see a united stable EU and a stable prosperous Britain  Li told a World Economic Forum gathering in the northern port city of Tianjin. ',Japan
' In the longer term the U.K. s exit could bring opportunities as well as risks. A U.K. facing marginalization in Europe could be more eager to boost ties with China a vital source of trade and financial business. The country   a key market for British cars drugs and machinery   represents 4.4 percent of the U.K. s exports about three times as much as a decade ago. ',Japan
' Brexit might end up as a blessing in disguise for China  said Ruan Zongze vice president of China Institute of International Studies a policy research group run by China s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It looks like a bad situation on the surface but there are opportunities that can be discovered and played up as long as there s effort on both sides.  ',Japan
' However a more conservative U.K. could turn instead to the U.S. and strengthen their old alliance. The nationalistic undercurrents to the Brexit debate could grow louder leading the U.K. to pull back from the free market orthodoxy that has favored greater ties with China. ',Japan
' If a more conservative leader takes over the successor may ditch the U.K. s current China strategy and move back toward its  special relationship  with the U.S.  said Zhang Baohui director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. A weakened EU which may see more defections after the British vote is not in China s grand strategic interests.  ',Japan
' Cameron spent four years overcoming the diplomatic fallout from his 2012 meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama which led to a freeze in communications with Beijing. He sought greater economic links including the award of a nuclear plant deal to Chinese companies and invested in personal ties with Xi epitomized by the fish and chips dinner they shared near Cameron s countryside estate in October. ',Japan
' Xi pledged more than  40 billion   53.6 billion  of investments during his visit including China General Nuclear Power Corp. s  6 billion contribution to building the Hinkley station in southwest England. The U.K. as an important member of the EU can play an even more positive and constructive role in promoting the deepening development of China EU ties  Xi said. ',Japan
' There s also the prospect that the Brexit result emboldens populist protectionist forces elsewhere in the West challenging a global trade system that has fueled China s economic rise at the expense of manufacturing jobs in developed economies. ',Japan
' China is a likely loser geo economically because the prospects for a more open global trade and investment environment are weakened  said William Overholt a senior fellow at Harvard University s Asia Center. The localist protectionist forces are strengthening everywhere and Brexit makes it clear that they are capable of successfully confronting the globalizing elite.  ',Japan
' The U.K. was the first European country to sign up for the China led AIIB a move that annoyed Washington but was quickly followed by Germany France Italy and others. London now handles the bulk of the EU s yuan trading and became the world s second largest renminbi clearing house worldwide after Hong Kong. ',Japan
' On the whole China would have preferred for their own self interest for the U.K. to stay in the EU  said Kerry Brown director of the Lau China Institute at King s College London and a former U.K. diplomat in Beijing. In the end I think that China will work to its advantage with whatever outcome eventually emerges.  ',Japan

' 5 Designers We Want Kate Middleton To Wear On Her Tour Of Pakistan ',Pakistan
' Ever since Kensington Palace shared news of Prince William and Kate Middleton s visit to Pakistan we haven t been able to contain our excitement. And now that the royal couple has finally touched down in the country we ve just got one thing on our minds   what will the Duchess wear  Kate Middleton has always had impeccable taste in fashion much like Princess Diana. On her visit in 1996 Diana chose to wear traditional Pakistani outfits made by the country s top designers and pulled them off beautifully. Kate has already worn exquisite pieces by Catherine Walker and Maheen Khan but here are five Pakistani designers we think she d look amazing in  ',Pakistan
' A post shared by Kensington Palace   kensingtonroyal  on Oct 14 2019 at 10 42am PDT ',Pakistan
' 1. Zara Shahjahan ',Pakistan
' One of Pakistan s leading high end labels Zara Shahjahan is effortlessly traditional and has that royal charm that would perfectly flatter the Duchess. From their summery printed shalwar kameez to flowy peshwas and solid formals their wide range of ethereal outfits will definitely do Kate s aesthetic justice  ',Pakistan
' 2.  lan ',Pakistan
' Known for their soft tones and intricate work  lan is a true reflection of classic style. Out of all their exquisite ensembles we would love to see Kate Middleton don their pastel hued embellished kaftans   our personal favourite. We re pretty sure the Duchess will carry them elegantly  ',Pakistan
' 3. HSY ',Pakistan
' HSY may be known for his glorious bridal wear but that s not his only claim to fame. His embroidered gowns with a touch of contemporary style are equally impressive  His elaborate gowns seem right up Kate Middleton s alley seeing as she s worn similar pieces in the past. After all who better than the King of couture to dress a future queen  ',Pakistan
' 4. Menahel   Mehreen ',Pakistan
' They may be relatively new in the fashion business but that hasn t stopped Menahel and Mehreen from making their mark in the fashion scene. From their Western wear or classic saris they have everything that would fit the Duchess s wardrobe perfectly  ',Pakistan
' 5. Misha Lakhani ',Pakistan
' Having followed Kate Middleton s fashion sense for a while we can safely say she has a soft spot for pastels and well fitted long dresses. Considering that our go to recommendation for the Duchess would be one of the classiest brands in the country   Misha Lakhani. The splendour of their outfits would impeccably complement Kate s sense of style. ',Pakistan

' Court orders LDA to vacate demolished Khokhar Palace site at once ',Pakistan
' LHC suspends action taken on DC Lahore s order  says demolition beyond comprehensible despite stay order ',Pakistan
' 13 shops and several temporary huts were demolished as the authorities aimed to recover 45 kanals of land. SCREENGRAB ',Pakistan
' LAHORE  ',Pakistan
' Lahore High Court  LHC  on Tuesday ordered the district administration to immediately vacate the site of Khokhar Palace and restrained the authority from any further action. ',Pakistan
' LHC Chief Justice Muhammad Qasim Khan also directed the law officer to assist the court regarding the question of the property being demolished despite a stay order from the civil court. ',Pakistan
' The province s top judge issued the verdict after hearing a plea filed by Khokhar brothers   MPA Malik Saiful Malook and MNA Malik Muhammad Afzal Khokhar   both belonging to Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz  PML N . ',Pakistan
' The petitioners had challenged the demolition despite an interim stay order granted by the civil court. ',Pakistan
' The court suspended the action taken on Lahore deputy commissioner s January 18 order cancelling the lease of land on which the demolitions were carried out. ',Pakistan
' Furthermore the court asked both the parties to approach the civil court for a settlement and ordered the local and provincial administration to not interfere in the petitioner s civil matter till the court has issued a final verdict on it. ',Pakistan
' Around 13 shops and several temporary huts were demolished on January 24 by the Lahore Development Authority  LDA  in a bid to recover 45 kanals of land. The officials claimed that out of 177 kanals only 131 was owned by the Khokhars. ',Pakistan
' The law officer contended that the petitioners had illegally constructed the property on the state land. ',Pakistan
' Earlier the petitioners through their counsel implored that the civil court had granted them stay but the government still demolished the property against the norms of the law. They contended that they are the lawful owners of the land measuring 177 kanals and six marlas. ',Pakistan
' They said that all the purchased property is through registered deeds that have not been challenged so far and are still legally intact. The property they added is with specific khasra numbers showing full specifications of the property. ',Pakistan
' The petitioners maintained that they applied for sanction of the building plans and after the completion of all the formalities and submission of requisite fees Tehsil Municipal Administration  TMA  approved nine building plans. ',Pakistan
' Later they completed the construction as per the approved plans without even a single infirmity or irregularity. ',Pakistan
' In 2016 Khokhar brothers said they applied for the approval of four other building plans to the LDA which were also approved under all legal formalities. ',Pakistan
' In 2018 in a suo muto proceeding against the petitioners no irregularity or illegality was found in the ownership of the stated properties. When a respondent member of the revenue board issued a notice they challenged it in the civil court and were granted interim stay. But even after the stay order the LDA issued notices to demolish the properties. ',Pakistan
' Later the owners approached the LHC that restrained the LDA from taking any adverse action against the structure and directed the civil court to decide the case within seven days after hearing both parties. ',Pakistan
' Subsequently the member of the revenue board issued notices to demolish the property on the basis of a letter of Additional Deputy Commissioner Revenue  ADCR  whereby it was reported that the petitioners  possession didn t match the ownership record based on the cancellation of the submitted building plans. ',Pakistan
' The Khokhar brothers challenged the order as well as the cancellation of building plans by the TMA by filing two separate civil lawsuits in the civil court. They were granted a stay order with the court restraining the TMA and district administration from demolishing dispossessing from the possessions and interfering in them. ',Pakistan
' Despite the stay on January 18 the respondent additional commissioner consolidation land commissioner cancelled the allotment of 153 kanal and 12 marla land covering the possession of the petitioner Saiful Malook Khokhar. ',Pakistan
' It is pertinent to mention that the additional commissioner opened a 30 year old past transaction of the allotment which was already finalised in the form of civil petitions in the country s top court. Later a civil court suspended the order. ',Pakistan

' Domiciles  Don t forget your place ',Pakistan
' Affirmative action can be a double edged sword. In Sindh it comes in the form of domicile which was introduced to protect people who lived in Sindh s countryside. Today it works against them and the people who live in the cities. ',Pakistan
' Take the example of a boy in Karachi who has just sat his intermediate exams and wants to go to medical school. He passes the entrance test but doesn t have enough marks to make the merit list. If he doesn t qualify for an urban quota seat he will have to apply to another college in rural Sindh. Then take the example of a young woman from Karachi who wants to get a job as a lecturer in a Sindh government college. But the job is only available for a rural quota that is someone from Larkana. As with most affirmative action policies domicile too started with the best of intentions in 1951. It became a way to register citizens because there was no way to verify who had opted to stay in Pakistan in the years after Partition. After people registered as citizens they could then qualify for government jobs or public schools and colleges. The domicile form was introduced to give proper representation to the people of Sindh  explains Syed Nur Ahmed Shah who served as deputy commissioner Tharparkar. People from all over Pakistan come to settle in Karachi.  As the standard of education in Sindh is not very good better qualified people from outside were attracted by the jobs. The domicile was meant to protect people from rural Sindh by ensuring they were given preference. These documents were valuable because they established the origin ethnic identity and status of migration of citizens. Application forms contain details of the district and province where citizens were born when they arrived into the district they want a domicile of and if they migrated from Bangladesh  former East Pakistan  or any other district they must  surrender  their original domicile certificate. Migrants from India who arrived in Pakistan before April14 1951 must submit a residence certificate. Questions in the permanent residence certificate form also seek to verify if and when the applicant s parents resided in Sindh. This information is then used to determine if applicants qualify for a rural or urban quota. Currently urban Sindh is defined as the city and cantonment areas of Karachi Hyderabad and Sukkur. The rest of the province is referred to as rural. Requirements for a domicile form 1. Three passport sized photos 2. Birth certificate from a grade 17 or above government officer senator MPA MNA member of a municipal committee or district council of the district 3. For applicants who migrated to Pakistan from India before April 14 1951 a residential certificate from a government officer  see above . 4. For migrants from the former East Pakistan or any other district the original domicile certificate must be surrendered 5. Documents of any immoveable property in the district 6. Documentary proof of occupation 7. Attested copy of an NIC or a Form  B  for applicants below the age of 18 8. Attested copy of educational certificates to the current year 9. If aged less than 21 a photocopy of the NIC and domicile of the father mother guardian 10. Attested service certificate if in government employ 11. House documents  Utility bills or an attested copy of the rent agreement if living in a rented house 12. For married men women photocopies of the spouse s NIC domicile and attested copies of their children s birth certificates or Form  B  13. Two attested photocopies of the NICs of residents from the neighbourhood 14. All photocopies neighbour forms and residence certificates must be attested by a nazim naib nazim or a class one officer 15. Rs200 fees to be paid at any branch of the National Bank of Pakistan 16. Affix a Rs1 ticket to all documents 17. Attestation of the domicile application by an Oath Commissioner 18. Attach original documents with photocopies History of quotas Kunwar Idris explains that the notion of reserved seats in government services and educational institutions came from Muslims living in pre partition India as leaders in Punjab demanded representation for the community because they had been kept  backward . Whether communal or provincial the founding principle came from the Muslims.  In the years after migration there were Mohajirs coming into Sindh in large numbers. The basis of the domicile was that the rights of Sindhis were to be protected because of people from other provinces coming to Karachi and Sindh for search of jobs. The Mohajirs up to this point were dominant in the bureaucracy and education while the indigenous Sindhis did not have the same influence. These quotas did not extend to other provinces such as Punjab   which also saw intense migration   because the migrants were all people who spoke one language. Rural Punjab Idris says had already benefited from the reserved seats it had won pre Partition. Required for admissions Domicile forms are required at all public educational institutions in Sindh. The Dow University of Health Sciences asks for 17 documents with applications to its undergraduate programmes including the applicant s domicile permanent residence certificate and NIC as well as the domicile and NIC of the applicant s father. The University of Sindh requires  Domicile certificate of candidate  or of father  mother if the applicant is under 18 years of age and his her name is included in it  and PRC  Original  to be shown at the time of payment in case of admission to quota oriented courses of study.  History of the domicile form The domicile form was introduced after the prime ministers of India and Pakistan Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan signed the Liaquat Nehru pact in 1950. It promised to protect minorities and improve relationships between the majority and minorities in their countries. It paved the way for the essential process of verifying who was a citizen of India and Pakistan because there was intense cross border migration in the years that followed Partition. After the Liaquat Nehru pact was signed Pakistan began to seal borders and in 1951 it introduced the Citizenship Act that required citizens to  claim  and verify their citizenship by obtaining a domicile. Illegitimate or insensitive  The permanent residence certificate form used today has alarmingly insensitive language. At one point it asks the applicant if they were claiming the certificate of permanent residence because  he was born in Sind of illegitimate birth and his mother at the time of his birth was domiciled in Sindh.  Some parts assume the applicant would be willing to answer this  In the case of a person of illegitimate birth the information required to be given above the father shall be given about his mother.  The form does not account for the female sex as all questions refer to applicants as his  or he . When the domicile was first introduced it was an easy process to get it made. Anyone could get a domicile but there were more stringent requirements for the  certificate   recalls former Sindh chief secretary Kunwar Idris. You had to show details of property etc.  Ex Sindh chief secretary Syed Sardar Ahmed recalls how it worked in the post Partition years. You would go to the nearby mukhtiar kaar  assistant collector   he would ask you a few questions about when you had migrated and where you lived and issue it.  The problem later arose on deciding how long a person had to live in an area before he could claim residence. Eventually it was decided that a person who lived in an area for three years could get a PRC. Most people then wanted  rural  domiciles because there were more jobs or would get  urban  domiciles so they could keep jobs here  Ahmed says. Syed Nur Ahmed Shah says the forms were not as effective. He recalls that people would often produce false statements about how long they had resided in Sindh for and where they had obtained an education from. While the form was effective for some it has not helped to its desired extent.  Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Faisal Subzwari says it takes a few thousand rupees to produce falsified certificates. While he says the forms create resentment it is a sensitive subject for his party since we have to ensure that there are no further divisions . Any amendments to the Sindh Permanent Residence Certificate Rules of 1971 would be up to the government since this is not a legislative act but administrative. Ahmed and Shah agree that the forms are antiquated and not needed when citizens are required to get NICs and birth certificates. These forms are just used to grab seats and jobs or for the Benazir Card they need a domicile of a certain area  Ahmed says. Kunwar Idris on the other hand says that the quotas did help Sindhis  and one should not begrudge them that.  While he agrees that the corrupt and unfair practices in place and the way society is managed means that every job depends on your connection  the PRC and domicile should not be rejected on the grounds that it is not being fairly implemented . One suggestion floated by Ahmed is that instead of getting a domicile and PRC made applicants could just submit a birth certificate and NIC. Idris says referring all applications back to NADRA doesn t make sense because it has nothing to do with the NIC per se but with the quotas. Published in The Express Tribune April 26th 2012.

' Mohatta Palace in Karachi ',Pakistan
' Near the seashores of Karachi there is a mesmeric building which always captures attention of people visiting sea view. Just across the street of Karachi s Famous Shrine of Sufi Saint Hazrat Abdullah Shah Ghazi there is a pink Anglo Mughal style building known as Mohatta Palace Karachi. ',Pakistan
' Mohatta Palace was built by Agha Ahmad Hussain first Renowned Muslim Architect of that time in 1927 by the orders of local businessman Shivratan Chandratan Mohatta who lived in Marwar town India and wanted to built a summer house for his family Mr. Shivratan choosed this place because of its prime location near seashores of Karachi but unfortunately he didn t spend much of his summers in this Palace as after two decades of its construction Independence of Indo Pak occurred and he decided to shift to India. Named after Mr. Shivratan Chandratan Mohatta this Palace is still known as Mohatta Palace. ',Pakistan
' After Mr. Mohatta s shifting this Palace became a property of newly formed Government of Pakistan who used it as an office of Ministry of Foreing Affairs. After that it was handed over to Mother of the Nation Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah Sister of Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah as her residence in 1964. Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah stayed there till she lasts in 1967 and at that time this palace was also knowned as Qasr e Fatima  Palace of Fatima . After her death her sister Mohtarma Shireen Bai used it as her residence and after her death it became disputed property between the generations of two sisters and for more than 10 years this building remained closed which affected the structure of the palace. Cracks were visible during that time as there was no one to take care of this historical Building. In 1995 Government of Pakistan took controls of this palace back and decided to build a museum in this historical palace. Therefore Ministry of Culture spent 70 Lac rupees on this palace from which 61 Lac Rs were spent in buying this Palace and rest were spent on its renovation. ',Pakistan
' Architecture  ',Pakistan
' Mr. Agha Ahmad Hussain designed Mohatta Palace in pure Anglo Mughal Style the Palace is constructed on 18500 Square feet area with the help of Gizri Lime Stone and Rajhistani Pink Jodhpuri Stone that grants this building a mesmeric look and provides it strength against weather as it was built near sea shore. ',Pakistan
' Its prominent element is its octagonal domes which are built in every corner of the palace designed purely in Anglo Mughal Style and Pink Jodhpuri Stone provides it elegance. ',Pakistan
' Two domes are located near the head access have curved stairways which drive up to the rooftop. At the far end opposite the entry is a room for amusement which has few steps on each side commanding directly into the gardens at the back of the palace. ',Pakistan
' Providing Mohatta palace great looks its front is paired with openings Stone braces  spandrels cupolas railings with flower patterned designs and good looking fences. There are nine domes in Mohatta palace while the intros in the forward facing portion opening into the park are of blue color and those in the back end area are curved windows with tainted glass. ',Pakistan
' On the ground floor large rooms are designed for entertainment purpose and on first floor private rooms like bedrooms were built. There is a balcony stipulated with a shade from extreme sunlight on the first floor of this Palace. On terrace there is also a beautiful temple dedicated to Hindu god Shiva  ',Pakistan
' The palace is exclusively completed with teak wood a graceful staircase long hallways and doors built with teak wood. ',Pakistan
' There are three plans of Mohatta Palace. Basement ground floor and first floor. In Basement there is a hot water pool chamber connected with changing room. This water pool was provided with the facility of hot on cold water according to the weather conditions. With Pool few opening were designed too so that the steam can go out of the chamber. It is also claimed that from the basement a tunnel was designed towards nearly located Hindu temple so that Mr. Mohatta can use a safe passage to offer his Worship. ',Pakistan
' Upon moving inside the palace there is a hallway which joins each room located on the ground floor. This floor includes large majestic rooms proposed for entertainment from which two are located on the right side and two on left. ',Pakistan
' When observed from outdoor the ground floor has two very decorative openings on each side of the entry containing of three closes in each. Same Openings were designed on the south side of the palace as well. ',Pakistan
' The first floor is designed for private living unlike the ground floor. Though there is a large hall in the center of this floor which have ten doors which opens in a hallways that are located in north and south while the rooms were deigned on east and west side of this hallway. Four large rooms designated as bedrooms can be seen here along with attached rest rooms and every room has two doors. Hallway stairs were designed in the south part of this floor which leads towards octagonal towers on the rooftop. ',Pakistan
' Windows were built similar to ground floor. One can take pleasure in the cool breeze and can have a look of beautiful scenes of seashore from the windows built on first floor towards terrace. Staircases coming all the way up from the ground floor through the frontal north and south octagonal towers attach the rooftop. ',Pakistan

' Sadiqgarh Palace  A world of lost beauty and splendor ',Pakistan
' It is yet another historical treasure which is completely ruined and wasted ',Pakistan
' What I loved most about southern Punjab were its narrow rural roads making their way through the heart of countryside along fields and orchards connecting the lives of small villages and towns. We were driving on one such road to Ahmedpur Sharqiya leaving Derawar Fort and Cholistan desert behind. ',Pakistan
' Dera Nawab Sahab near Ahmedpur Sharqiya is home to Bahawalpur s royal family. The Nawabs founded this small town as a retreat from the busy life of the capital. Dera Nawab Sahab is also the location of magnificent Sadiqgarh Palace principle royal residence of the Nawab of Bahawalpur. It was our destination too. Making way through sprawling bazaars we found ourselves driving on the road parallel to the high walls of Sadiqgarh Palace complex. I recognized the imposing gateway of the palace from a vintage picture I had come across in which Bahawalpur s state military was presenting a guard of honor to President Iskander Mirza and Gen. Ayub Khan. The gateway is an impressive structure decorated with intricate stone carving brick work and fresco painting. Beyond the gate and the palace grounds stood the magnificent white structure of Sadiqgarh Palace. ',Pakistan
' The palace was constructed in 1895. It has seen its days of splendor and magnificence being the principle residence of one of the wealthiest princes of British India. The palace has ninety nine rooms which were decorated with the most beautiful and expensive furnishings and carpets. In its heyday the palace hosted Kings and Queens Maharajas and Nawabs Presidents and Prime Ministers and foreign dignitaries. Centuries old treasures of the Abbasid dynasty and wealth of the most fertile districts of Punjab were at its disposal. Its hosts were generous and entertained in a lavish manner. It was just like an oasis in the desert. Sadiqgarh offered such luxuries which were rare in those days. The palace had its own cinema theater. Its motor garages had finest models of the most expansive and fashionable cars of the age. It had an impressive library and a vast collection of antiques and valuables. It can be assumed without a single doubt that many a magical nights have unfolded within its walls and the palace has been a setting for historical moments. It remained a royal residence till a couple of decades after the princely state s merger into Pakistan. Glories of the palace faded after the demise of the Nawab in 1966. It had to be abandoned due to an ongoing litigation regarding its rightful ownership between the descendents of Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi the last ruling Nawab of Bahawalpur. The palace lost its remaining glow in years of disuse and abandonment. ',Pakistan
' Sadiqgarh presents a desolate picture of lost glory and ravages of changing times. Once vast gardens of the palace have now been shortened by erecting ugly walls. The remaining gardens are unkempt and neglected with overgrown grass and untended trees. A couple of gardeners were working quietly beside the roses and rather looked like ghosts of some 19th century gardeners. The garden is divided into four sub gardens on the Persian chaharbagh design. There is a handsome arched pavilion at the center. Artificial roses of different colors were planted in the flower beds of each garden. We park the car in the portico. Palace keys had been entrusted to a simple local man who knew nothing about the palace except that he must never open locks for anyone. He had inherited the key after his father s death a couple of months ago. My excellent guide Suhail conducted parleys in his usual sweet Seraiki and lured the man into opening the lock for us. ',Pakistan
' Interior of Sadiqgarh Palace was a semi dark world of forgotten glory. There was a silent marble fountain in the entrance hall and beyond the three arches was the great durbar hall robbed of its beauty and pushed into the dark annals of oblivion. When the palace was abandoned it was stripped bare of all its furniture and precious decorative articles including the massive chandeliers hanging from the high ceiling of the durbar hall. Remains of torn curtains on the arches withered carpets and the great mirror of the durbar hall was all that remained of the great palace. History tells that the huge durbar hall mirror which was higher than a single story of the palace was ordered from London. It was shipped to Karachi but there was no way of transporting it up to Bahawalpur. To solve the problem the Nawab ordered extension of all platforms from Karachi to Bahawalpur and doubled the railway track. The giant mirror was placed behind the royal throne and reflected the pomp and show of the entire durbar hall in its full regalia. Bahawalpur s merger into Pakistan and death of the dynasty were reflected in the mirror. It also witnessed ruining and looting of its royal home. Today it reflects nothing but darkness. The mirror remains at the palace because it was too grand for the looters to carry. ',Pakistan
' Darkness of the hall was pierced by the light coming from a window high up in the ceiling. Exquisite design of the ceiling and coat of arms of the princely state of Bahawalpur were visible in the scarce light. There is another hall parallel to the durbar hall approached by several entrances. It served as the dining room. Its wooden interior and classy ceiling were past their peak time. Fireplaces had gone cold forever. There were several other rooms along the dining hall which may have been used as sitting or waiting rooms or perhaps to play billiard or snooker. There s even an antique elevator in the entrance hall. Palace kitchens were in the far left corner. There are extensive basements under the palace. ',Pakistan

' President Iskander Mirza receives a guard of honor at Sadiqgarh Palace ',Pakistan
' Most exquisite of the ninety nine rooms of Sadiqgarh is the Turkish room towards the left of the durbar hall. The caretaker introduced it as the Sheesh Mahal and he wasn t exaggerating. The roof and walls of this room were decorated with small mirrors beautifully arranged in geometric patterns alongside floral frescos on the walls. Stain glass was used in the windows. There was a dry marble fountain in the floor. The room of mirrors was in complete darkness. It lit up with the beam of my flashlight and unfolded the magic within. Nawabs of Bahawalpur were truly the Mughals of their time. ',Pakistan
' The caretaker expressly forbade us to explore the first floor of the palace. It looked haunted enough and we were easily discouraged. The caretaker and Suhail went towards the main door to argue with a party which was trying to enter. In the meantime I stood on Nawab s throne in front of the mirror and tried to contemplate the terrible beauty my senses had been exposed to in the past half an hour. I felt at a complete loss of words. Sadiqgarh made me incredibly sad. History is packed with conquerors destroying history and heritage of the conquered but Bahawalpur s royal treasures were plundered and destroyed by the royal family itself. I tried to imagine the palace in its glorious days. Durbar hall showered in the light of its massive crystal chandeliers floors hidden under finest of Persian carpets the shining grand mirror reflecting regalia of the court the Nawab in his royal robes and crown sitting on a gold chair courtiers seated in the hall in their court uniforms and scarlet fez caps sharp looking British officers and their beautiful wives waltzing to the haunting tunes of orchestra begums in traditional attire and bedecked in jewelry from head to toe witnessing the court proceedings from behind the veil. It was a world too beautiful to be true. As I came back to reality there was nothing but silence and darkness in the durbar hall. ',Pakistan

' Out in the garden one gardener tempted me to visit the royal motor garage in the palace compound. Nawab sahab s personal cars are still parked in it but in a very desolate condition. I would ve loved to visit the garage but I had to decline because time was really short and I had to see the city of Bahawalpur before sunset. Rumor has it that the palace also contains a number of royal cannons which are worth looking at. ',Pakistan
' Sadiqgarh Palace is yet another historical treasure which is completely ruined and wasted. Princely states in the Subcontinent couldn t continue living in delusions of grandeur and had to adjust with the changing times. All over India palaces and forts have been converted into revenue generating hotels museums and tourism sites. One fine example is Falaknuma Palace of Hyderabad Deccan. It served as a royal guest house in the time of Nizam. The beautiful palace has been converted into a luxury hotel while the present nominal Nizam continues residing in the principle Chowmahalla Palace. Even Taragarh Palace Nawab of Bahawalpur s summer residence at Palampur Himachal Pardesh which was acquired by Maharaja Kashmir in 1951 has been converted into a heritage hotel. Bahawalpur House in New Delhi serves as National School of Drama. On the contrary the royal family of Bahawalpur has lost all its beautiful palaces over time. Palaces in the city have been sold off to the military. Derawar remains ruined and unmaintained and Sadiqgarh was destroyed by the family feud and decades of litigation. Converting palaces into hotels is a fine way to preserve these historical treasures. Bahawalpur s priceless heritage can be restored to its former glory in this way. It awaits its savior to this day.

' Question 1 Tell in your own words how the first meeting came off between the two distant cousins  ',Pakistan
' Answer Rudolf leaves the inn one day as he is given an opportunity to stay at Jahan s sister at Strelsau. Instead of going he decides to walk through the forest and have a look at the castle of Zenda. He sits down in the forest to have some rest as well as smoke a cigar. After smoking his cigar he unintentionally falls asleep. Shouts and sound of laughter wake him up. On opening his eyes he sees two men standing near him. They are Fritz Von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt. They tell him that he looks exactly like their king except that he has a beard. At that moment King Rudolf appears. Rassendyll greatly surprises to see king Rudolf in the forest of Zenda. He gives a cry when he finds that Rudolf is just like him. Rudolf s face and appearance are quite like his own. Rudolf s height appears to be slightly less than his. Rassendyll bows respectfully before the king. In a happy mood the King invites Rassendyll to have a dinner with him. At dinner the King takes drugged wine sent to him by his half brother Michael. He becomes unconscious. Thus it becomes a serious problem being the fixed day of the coronation ceremony. Anyhow Col. Sapt and Captain Fritz request Rassendyll to have off his beard and impersonate the king just to save the kingdom of Ruritania. He agrees to do so he acts very tactfully. By this way the meeting of the two distant cousins proves fruitful. ',Pakistan
' Question 2 Describe the measure adopted to frustrate the plot against the King. ',Pakistan
' Answer Sapt and Fritz were two zealous upholders of Rudolf Elphberg s succession to the throne of Ruritania. Michael had succeeded in giving the King drugged wine and unconscious King could neither attend the coronation nor be present before the large number of people who had assembled in Strelsau to witness his coronation. Through arguments Sapt succeeded in persuading Rudolf to shave off his beard and appeared at the contention in place of Rudolf Elphberg. He would attend the coronation and be crowned as the King. The real King was to be left behind in the cellar and Joseph a trustworthy servant was entrusted with duty of looking after him. There plan was to go to Strelsau where Rassendyll would be crowned that very evening. Sapt would come back to the lodge and take the real King away to Strelsau and Rudolf Rassendyll would be secretly taken to the frontier and packed off to England his home. Having this plan before them the three took the train for Strelsau. ',Pakistan
' Question 3 How did Black Michael kidnap the King  What precaution did he take to keep him safely imprisoned  ',Pakistan
' Answer Duke Michael kidnapped the king. He wanted that the king could not reach at the place of coronation in time. He gave him drugged wine the king became senseless and he kidnapped him. Afterwards Michael s men killed Josef and kidnapped the king. Michael imprisoned the king in a small room in his old castle at Zenda. This room had only one window near the surface of the moat. This moat was full of water to stop anyone trying to reach the king s room. There was only one entrance to this room from an inner room. Three strong men Michael were always on guard. There was large pipe going the window of the king s room to the moat. Michael had ordered his strong men to kill the king if they were attacked. Then they had to throw his body into the moat through the pipe. They could run away from the place through the same pipe. ',Pakistan
' Question 4 Give an account of the coronation and describe Rassendyll s behavior at it. ',Pakistan
' Answer After Josef has shaved off Rassendyll s beard he wears the king s dress. Rassendyll reaches the church for the coronation in procession. A richly dressed priest stands ready to receive him. Princess Flavia and Black Michael are also present among the dignified persons. Michael grows pale and his helmet falls off his head to see Rassendyll appear as the king. Michael never expects that King could be there. The high priest performs the ceremony of applying crown to his head. Rassendyll stands up stretches his hands and takes the crown from the priest s hand. He places the crown on his head he takes the oath of the king. Then he performs the last ceremony  The Holy Sacrament  before all the persons. There is grand music once again. It is then loudly declared that Rudolf the fifth has become the king. Thus ends the coronation. Rudolf has become such a successful understudy  none is able to detect the personating. Though Flavia notices the behavior of the King has undergone a change but she considers this to be the result of coronation and the assumption of authority and responsibility. Apparently things go on smoothly and the fraud would be a grand and easy success if the real King was taken captive by Michael. ',Pakistan

' Answer Cot. Sapt and Rassendyll wanted to save the life of King Rudolf.

Rassendyll and Sapt rushed on their horses towards those men. The killed a couple of them and returned to Strelsau. ',Pakistan
' Question 6 Who arranged the ball and why  And what was the outcome of that arrangement  ',Pakistan
' Answer Rassendyll and Sapt came to know about the discontent which was spreading among the people of Strelsau. The reason was that the common people who dearly loved Princess Flavia wanted the marriage of the King and Flavia should be solemnized early. The people feared that the King was not showing due respect and regard to Flavia and some of them had begun to show a learning in favor of Michael and see the Princess married to the Duke. Sapt and Fritz had then arranged a public ball to be given by the King to honor of Flavia. They advised Rassendyll to make a great show of his love for Princess and make it clear to the guests that he was deeply in love with her. The proposed ball was held and proved to be a great success.

She advises him to leave the place at once and avoids meeting Michael s men. She says that she is in love with Michael and for this reason she cannot see him marry Princess Flavia.

' Answer When the Duke s men led by Detchard arrive at the Summer House they claim admittance to the room where Rassendyll and de Mauban are having their meeting. Detchard offers Rassendyll fifty thousand pounds English and promises him safe conduct to the frontier. The only condition laid down by him is to go away from Ruritania. Rudolf proves too clever for the game being played. He knows Detchard and his men are trying to gain easy admittance after which they want to kill him. Rudolf discusses for sometimes the offer made by Detchard and expresses his agreement. When the door is opened Detchard and his men rush at him. However he is ready to meet their attack and charges at them holding in his hands an iron topped table. Rassendyll using an iron tea table escapes unhurt.

' Answer Rassendyll s Sapt and Fritz and ten reliable persons with them went to the chateau of Tarienheim The owners of the chateau were a relation of fritz. This chateau was only five miles away from Zenda. An hour after Rassendyll s arrival three of the size strong men of Michael came to meet him. In the evening Rassendyll visited the inn where he had stayed of his first arrival at Zenda. He fixed his meeting with John Michael s servant outside with the help of the girl Johan wishe to marry. Reaching the chateau he learned that one of hi ten gentlemen Bernenstein had been wounded by Michael s man. The next morning Rupert Hentazu had an interview with Rassendyll the ground of the chateau of Tarienheim. Rupert said that Michael would pay Rassendyll a million crown if he left Ruritania. Rassendyll at once refused the offer. Then they talked about the imprisoned king and princess Flavia for some time. Rupert mounted his horse and hit Rassendyll with his dagger. Rassendyll was wounded on his shoulder. Rassendyll s friends were only thirty yards away from him. They ran to kill Rupert. They fired their revolvers at him. But he ran away on his horse. ',Pakistan
' Question 10 What was the Jacob s ladder  Give an account of the first attempt of Rassendyll at it  ',Pakistan
' Answer The king of Ruritania was imprisoned in the castle of Zenda. The Duke Michael had connected the king s room to the moat through a big pipe. This pipe was of earthen ware. It was so large that a man could easily slip through it from the room to the moat. It was called by Rupert as Jacob s ladder. The Duke had ordered the guards that whenever an attempt was made to liberate the king they should kill him tie a weight to his body and throw it through the pipe down into the moat. The murderers could also escape through the Jacob s ladder similarly. Rassendyll got full information from Johann about the king s room. When Rassendyll Sapt and Fritz took three soldiers and went towards the castle. Swimming across it he went up to the earthen pipe. Near the pipe Max Holf elder brother of Jahan was on duty. To avoid detection Rassendyll killed that man with a knife. Through the hole in the pipe he was able to hear the conversation between Detchard and the King. The voice of King was feeble and faint and he appeared to be leading wretched life. Rudolf then swam back to his friends. Just then they had a fight with Rupert Lauengram and Krafstein. In the fight two Rassendyll s party men and two of Micheal s trusted followers Krafstein and Lauengram were killed. The matter was complicated when people came to know the death of men. The government covered up the matter by giving out that they had been killed in private quarrel. Moreover duels were banned and made punishable under the law by Rassendyll. ',Pakistan
' Question 11 How did the police misgivings about the prisoner of Zenda complicate the matter  ',Pakistan
' Answer Once the Perfect of police came to Zenda and told Rassendyll that he was in search of a man who had come from England to France and later to Ruritania. The whereabouts of that man were not traceable then and British Ambassador was keen that the man might be traced and found out. This was very irritating piece of news for Rassendyll. He knew that if he was traced out by the police it would not be possible for him to keep playing the game in the interests of the King of Ruritania. The Perfect of police had been able to get information from George Featherly that the young man he was searching for had come to Ruritania by the same train which had brought Madame de Mauban. The Perfect of police feared that Rassendyll had been captured in the castle of Zenda out of jealousy by Micheal. Rassendyll met the challenge by using his authority ordered the Perfect to go back to Strelsau and took the matter in his hand. ',Pakistan
' Question 12 How did Rassendyll liberate the real king from the prison  ',Pakistan
' Answer Rassendyll made a final attempt to liberate the King from the cell. He took Madame De Mauban in his confidence. According to scheme Rassendyll swam across the moat. He hid near the pipe coming out of the window of the king s room. The drawbridge was over the moat. A light was burning in Michael s room. Madame De Mauban and Rupert were there. Detchard one of the strong men of Michael entered the king s room to kill him. He killed the king s doctor who resisted him. Soon Rassendyll also entered the King s room.There he had a fierce fight with Detchard whom he ultimately killed. Rassendyll came of the king s room. Rupert was standing on the bridge keeping Michael s servants away. De Mauban also appeared there. She fired at Rupert. The shot misses and he jumped into the most and swam away. Sapt and Fitz had already entered the castle. The castle was then in the hands of Rassendyll and his companions. They saved the lives of the king and De Mauban. ',Pakistan
' Question 13 Give an account of Rupert s escape from Zenda  ',Pakistan
' Answer As soon as Rassendyll had saved the king in the castle of Zenda he at once came out. He found Rupert standing on the bridge and threatening Michael s servants with his arms not to come to him. Madame de Mauban appeared on the other side of the bridge. She fired at Rupert with her revolver. Her shot missed him. Rupert jumped into the moat and swam away. Rassendyll also jumped into the moat and swam after Rupert. He had a wounded arm so he could not easily reach Rupert. Rupert found the rope lied to the bank of the moat earlier left by Rassendyll. He took hold of it and climbed to the bank. He stood there with his sword. Rassendyll also reached the rope but was afraid of reaching the bank. The Rupert stood ready to kill him and Rassendyll climbed to the bank. He saw Rupert running towards the forest. Rassendyll started running after Rupert. But Rupert was quite ahead of him. In the way Rupert found a girl on her horse. He took horse from girl. He rode it and began to come towards Rassendyll. The talked angrily for some time and then there was a fight between them. Rassendyll attacked him first with his sword. But his attack missed him. Then Rupert attacked him and pushed him back. Rassendyll wounded. Then Rassendyll sat down expecting an attack. Rupert could have killed him but just then Fritz Rassendyll s friend appeared there on the horse. He had a revolver. Rupert saw him. Then saying Good bye he started running away Fritz fired at him but his short missed him. Rupert rode away into the forest and disappeared. ',Pakistan
' Question 14 How did Flavia know the true identity of Rudolf Rassendyll  ',Pakistan
' Answer When Rassendyll had rescued the King Sapt had to make the real King take place of Rassendyll and put out a story which would explain the events of the fight without disclosing the fact Rassendyll had been posing as the King since the day of the coronation. The story was put out that Michael had imprisoned a friend of King. He was killed and the King was gravely wounded when the King went to rescue his friend. However Flavia insisted on seeing the King at once. She was riding to the castle just when Rassendyll had reached the edge of the forest by the road to the castle. The farm girl seeing Rassendyll and believing him to be the King ran to Princess saying that the King was wounded and lying in the nearby bushes. Sapt did not wish her to go as he knew well that the man lying there was Rassendyll. Princess along with Sapt walked up to him. First Sapt told her that he was not the king. Then Rassendyll himself said that he was not the king thus she came to know the truth about Rassendyll. Flavia was shocked to find that her lover was not the king. She had loved him from the core of heart. She felt so sad and fainted. ',Pakistan
' Q15. Elaborate the chapter If Love Were All. ',Pakistan

' Answer In this chapter Rudolf Rassendyll was present in the castle of Zenda. He paid a short visit to the ailing king who was still in under treatment. He was waiting for his companions to arrive on the scene so that the king might be taken to safety. Just then the king s party arrived at the scene and made necessary preparations to rescue the king. They succeeded in taking away the unconscious king. Rassendyll had fainted on account of his wounds and knew nothing of what was happening. Captain Fritz made an arrangement of meeting between Rudolf Rassendyll and Princess Flavia. Princess Flavia showed her great affection and love to Rassendyll. She said  ',Pakistan
' Honour binds a woman too Rudolf. My honour lies in being true to my country and my house. I don t know why God had let me love you  but I know that I must stay  ',Pakistan
' Your ring will always be on my finger your heart in my heart. But you must go and I must stay. Perhaps I must do what it kills me to think of doing. ',Pakistan
' Answer Thus in their short meeting both Rudolf Rassendyll and Princess Flavia agreed that they must sacrifice their love for the people of Ruritania. After that short meeting with Princess Flavia Rudolf Rassendyll went towards the station with Sapt and Fritz. Both Sapt and Fritz said good bye to Rassendyll with great affection. ',Pakistan
' Question 16 .Show how Flavia sacrifices love and ambition to duty and honor. ',Pakistan
' Answer Rassendyll was staying at the castle of Zenda after saving the King. Princes Flavia had also reached there. Rassendyll went into Princess Flavia s room. Flavia said that she had a duty to her country and to her royal family. She loved Rassendyll but she could not live with him. Rassendyll had to leave for England and Flavia had to stay in Ruritania to be named to King Rudolf. Rassendyll was sad to hear Flavia s words. He said he would keep her ring and would continue to love her. He wished her every comfort. Flavia decided not to marry Rassendyll because she was loyal to her people of country and the king. She sacrificed love to duty. She took the right step at the right moment. Her marriage to King Rudolf was quite necessary to keep the people satisfied and peaceful. ',Pakistan
' Question 17 Heaven does not always make the right men kings  said Fritz. Do you think Rassendyll deserves to be the king of Ruritania  If so why  ',Pakistan
' Answer In his role as the king Rudolf Rassendyll is far more impressive than the real king Rudolf Elphberg. He carries out his duties as a king majestically and tactfully without revealing his true identity. People love him and none cares to find out whether he is the real king or not. Within few days he makes for himself a place in their hearts. On considering his qualities Colonel Sapt Fritz and Marshall like him and they want that he would work as the King but they all are loyal to their state. Due to best qualities of Rudolf Rassendyll he deserves to be the King of Ruritania. ',Pakistan
' Question 18 Colonel Sapt s Wisdom made it impossible for Black Michael to get the throne of the Ruritania Elucidate. ',Pakistan
' Answer Colonel Sapt is an old and experienced man. He is a brave man. He has got a highly fertile and productive mind. Most of the scheme and plots for the safety of real king in the novel are the creation of his mind. He possesses a very sharp mind. He encounters difficult situation with wisdom of an old man. He makes quick decision on all occasion and saves Rassendyll from danger and helps in rescuing the real king. Hence we can say that Colonel Sapt s wisdom makes it impossible for Black Michael to get the throne of Ruritania. Sapt is a faithful servant. He always tries for the betterment of the king. He admits that Rassendyll is a better man to rule over the country but he does not let him even stay in the country after the freedom of the king. ',Pakistan
' Question 19 Johan plays a vital role in the plot of the novel. Refute or justify your answer briefly. ',Pakistan
' Answer Throughout the novel the character of Johan has served well to Rassendylls party. From him they learn about the King who is kept a close prisoner in the castle of Zenda. He also tells them about the arrangements for keeping an efficient watch on him. Michael has told his Six not to take any risks in the matter. In addition to the castle is surrounded by a water filled moat. The King s cell has a window and is placed in the water of the moat. Furthermore Michael has instructed his men to kill the King and throw it into the water through the big earthen pipe named Jacob s ladder among ruffians. Later he becomes a messenger of Rudolf and de Mauban. Through Johann Rudolf is able to communicate with de Mauban and directs her to do as she is told. Johan is also directed to open the main gate at 2 o clock so that Sapt s party can execute their role. In short Johan can rightly be called as a bridge for Rassendyll and his company to rescue the King. ',Pakistan
' Question 20 Explain how the novel progresses because both Michael and Rassendyll cannot tell others about each other  ',Pakistan
' Answer Michael wants to become king. That is why he has tried to keep the King Rudolf away from the coronation. Now Rassendyll knows everything that he has done to the King. It is before Rassendyll that the king has taken the drugged wine sent by Michael. When the king becomes unconscious Rassendyll begins impersonating him and goes to the coronation in his place. No doubt Michael is shocked to see Rassendyll impersonating the king at the coronation. Though he wants to but he cannot open his mouth about Rassendyll s impersonation  he knows that if he does so Rassendyll will tell all his secrets to the People. On his part Rassendyll does not and cannot tell others about Michael s secrets he knows that it he does so Michael will at once has King Rudolf kill. Michael has imprisoned the king in the cast at Zenda. Thus the novel progresses because Michael and Rassendyll must be silent before the people about each other. ',Pakistan
' Question 21 Antoinette de Mauban betrayed Black Michael rightly. Discuss. ',Pakistan
' Answer Antoinette de Mauban is a widow rich and ambitious. She is a graceful fashionably dressed French lady. She is educated and sophisticated lady and moves in the highest circle of the Paris society. She has no political interest but her ambition to win Black Michael involves her completely in the intrigues and the counter intrigues. She has come to strelsau to safeguard her own interest. She loves Black Michael above her head and soul but she knows very well the intention of Black Michael who wants to get married to Princess and be the king of Ruritania. She clearly tells Rudolf Rassendyll  ',Pakistan
' Say I am Christian or say I am jealous. ',Pakistan
' May God shall I see him marry her. ',Pakistan
' Madam de Mauban has great courage determination and will power but participation in the struggle for succession is based upon personal aims and motives when she sees that Black Michael is neglecting her then she betrays him and tells everything about his devilish plot to Rassendyll and Flavia. ',Pakistan
' Question 22 Between Black Michael and Rupert of Hentzau which character strikes you as more devilish  Give reasons. ',Pakistan
' Answer Black Michael is more devilish character than Rupert of Hentzau in Anthony Hope s novel The Prisoner of Zenda. Rupert of Hentzau is a leading member of Black Michael gang of ruffians but he holds a unique position between the forces of good and evil. He is very ambitious. He kills Black Michael only to get Mauban. He is fond of wine and women. He is very sharp both at his tongue and sword. Black Michael is by nature a schemer and all the time his mind remains busy in making plots for establishing his right to the throne. He invites the king to his forest lodge and imprisons him. He is a cruel man. He makes several plots to kill Rassendyll at Summer House at the palace of Princess Flavia and at many other places. He is a traitor because he wants to capture the throne of Ruritania. He is not a courageous man. He never tries himself to kill the enemy. He always sends his six villains The hired guns  to deal with his enemies. He is also lustful towards the women. He promises Mauban to marry her. But now he is after Flavia only to get the throne. He imprisons the poor widow. He is extremely selfish cunning and ambitious. Rupert of Hentzau only takes pride on his strength but Black Michael makes scheme to deal with his enemies so he is more devilish and hateful character. We begin to hate him as soon as his evil nature is exposed to us and our hatred is intensified with the advancement of the story. When he is killed we do not feel any sympathy for him. He is rightly punished for his wickedness. ',Pakistan
' Question 23 De Mauban played a very significant role in the novel The Prisoner of Zenda Comment. ',Pakistan
' Answer Madam De Mauban is a widow rich handsome and ambitious. She is a graceful fashionably dressed French lady. She has no political interest but her ambitions to fascinate Black Michael involves her completely in the intrigues and the counter intrigues. Black Michael compels her to write a letter to Rudolf Rassendyll and invites him alone in the Summer House. He deputes three ruffians to kill him there. De Mauban saves Rudolf Rassendyll from this devilish scheme of Michael. She loves Black Michael but she helps Rudolf Rassendyll. She is shifted to the castle of Zenda along with Black Michael. The Duke decides to invite Princess Flavia in order to trap her there. She immediately writes a letter to Princess Flavia and informs her and forbids her to accept the invitation of Black Michael. She sends a message to Rudolf Rassendyll through Johann to rescue her. She is also assigned a great role to be played in the final plan of attack. Thus Madam De Mauban helps Princess Flavia and Rudolf Rassendyll in order to save the real king of Ruritania. ',Pakistan
' Question 24 Prisoner of Zenda is a tale of romance and adventure  Discuss. ',Pakistan
' Answer The story of the novel The Prisoner of Zenda is based on adventure and romance. A young man of rich family of England comes to visit Ruritania where he meets with the future King of Ruritania. The king invites him at the dinner a party in his honor and drinks a lot of wine and falls asleep. Rassendyll who resembles in feature with the king under takes the assignment to attend the coronation ceremony in place of Elphberg. The King is imprisoned and his supporters want to free him. For Rassendyll it is an adventure to bring the real King back to the throne. On the other hand this is also a story of romance. Flavia the princess of Ruritania is the symbol of romance in the novel. She is lonely and gentle soul who is loved dearly by the people of Ruritania. She deeply falls in love with Rudolf Rassendyll. Similarly Madam Mauban is in love with Black Michael and countess Helga is beloved of Fritz. In this sense it can be said that The Prisoner of Zenda is a story of adventure and romance. ',Pakistan
' Question 25 Bring out the points of resemblance and difference between Rudolf Rassendyll and King Rudolf  ',Pakistan
' Answer Points of Resemblance  ',Pakistan
' The name Rudolf was common to them both. Both had dark red hair. Their noses were long. Their faces quite resembled each other. Their bodies were strong. On the whole they physically resembled each other much. No one could find out their differences easily. When Rassendyll wore the King s clothes and went to Strelsau everyone was deceived. At the coronation and on other occasions Rassendyll was taken as the king. Both Rassendyll and king Rudolf were young men. They had strong passions of love. Both of them had descended from the same King of Ruritania. ',Pakistan
' Points of Differences  ',Pakistan
' Rassendyll was slightly taller than King Rudolf. He had a beard and moustaches on. Rassendyll did not take so much wine as Elphberg did. Thus Elphberg was not as active as Rassendyll. He was also very careless. Rassendyll was not careless or foolish like him. His face was slightly thinner and more serious than that of Elphberg. Rassendyll invited dangerous and faced them boldly at the cost of his own life. Elphberg was rather lazy dull and weak. That is why perhaps princess Flavia liked Rassendyll more than King Rudolf.

He is bold enough to declare his true love to Princess Flavia even though he knows that it is a futile attempt as he is a commoner while she is a true princess. He is also brave enough to confess to her the fact that he is not the true king but only an imposter. He willingly goes to meet Madam de Mauban alone at night at her place even though he knows that it is a trap set by Black Michael. When he successfully manages to kill three of the famous Six  his bravery is made more prominent. He is then forced to have a duel with the notorious Rupert of Hentzau.

' Question 12 Write about the character that you dislike. Give reasons for your answers. ',Pakistan
' Answer In the novel The Prisoner of Zenda  Black Michael is undeniably the most evil character. Throughout the story he is being described as a selfish sinful and shameful man who uses others to get to his own ends. He loves Princess Flavia just to get the throne. He is a hypocrite and pretends to love Madam de Mauban where in reality he is just using her. He is also over ambitious and greedy. He makes a plot to get the throne with the aid of his Famous Six . He even treats his own brother King Rudolf V whom he holds captive in the Prisoner of Zenda with cruelty. Besides being wicked he is also a cool minded and genius criminal. When he discovers that Rudolf is an imposter he does not disclose the secret to the public to keep his villainy secret. Towards the end of the story Black Michael becomes utterly blind for power. However unfortunately for him his lust for power corrupts him and brings his decline whereby he meets his death in the hand of Rupert of Hentzau. Thus the villain of the story receives a tragic end. ',Pakistan
' Question 13 Write about the behavior of a character that you do not like. Give reasons for your choice. ',Pakistan

In this story he fights and intended to kill Rudolf Rassendyll the hero of the story but he fails in his mission.

' Question 14 Write about the character that you consider an unkind. Give reason for your choice. ',Pakistan
' Answer The novel is about Duke Michael s attempts to overtake the throne of Ruritania from his own brother King Rudolf V. To achieve his ambition he becomes mean and greedy. Therefore an unkind character in this story is Duke Michael. He puts his own brother King Rudolf in prison and tortures him. He even hires The Famous Six  to help in his plan to kill the King. He is also unkind to Antoinette de Mauban who is in love with him. He uses everybody just to get to his own need. Duke Michael does not show any good qualities. ',Pakistan
' Question 15 .Write about the characters that work together. Give examples of how they work together to support your answers. ',Pakistan
' Answer In this story the two characters that always work together is Rudolf Rassendyll and Colonel Sapt. They work side by side to ensure that the throne of Ruritania is safe from Duke Michael. They help each other very well. When Rassendyll impersonates the King Colonel Sapt constantly advises him how to behave. They also work closely together to rescue the King from Duke Michael s castle. If Rassendyll and Colonel Sapt did not work together King Rudolf would be killed and then surely Black Michael would become the King of Ruritania. ',Pakistan

I would commend Rassendyll for not giving in to the temptation to let Rupert kills the King so that he could marry Princess Flavia. Rassendyll knows that this would be a dishonorable thing to do. I would praise Rassendyll for his bravery in fighting Duke Michael and Rupert and in rescuing the King ',Pakistan
' EVENTS Questions  ',Pakistan
' Question 1 Write about an event that you think is important in the story. Give reasons for your choice. ',Pakistan
' Answer  The Prisoner of Zenda  tells the story of how the cunning Duke Michael tries to replace his brother as King of Ruritania. An important event in the story is when Rudolf Rassendyll accidentally meets King Rudolf in the forest. This event is important because it is the first time we have found out that Rassendyll and the King Rudolf look alike. This allows Rassendyll to act as King when tKing Rudolf is captured by Duke Michael. If this event had not happened Duke Michael would have been crowned King of Ruritania. ',Pakistan
' Question 2 Write about a situation that is tense. Give reasons to support your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer In the novel The Prisoner of Zenda there are many tense situations being described. One of them is when Rudolf Rassendyll is hiding in the moat attempting to rescue King Rudolf for the second time. He is waiting for Johann to open the castle door at 2 o clock. One of Black Michael s soldiers Rupert Hentzau throws an empty bottle into the moat and fires at it many times. One of the bullets nearly touches Rudolf s hair. A few minutes later Rupert Hentzau enters and swims across the same moat that Rudolf is hiding in. Luckily he does not discover Rudolf although they are very close to each other. Rupert Hentzau is a ruthless killer and he could gladly kill Rudolf if he had the chance. Rudolf comes so close to death and at that moment it surely makes the readers very tense and uptight. ',Pakistan
' Question 3 Write about a happy situation. Give example to support your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer Based on the novel The Prisoner of Zenda  one happy occasion Is the night before King Rudolf s coronation. King Rudolf invites Rudolf Rassendyll whom he fondly referres to as his brother  to dinner. Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt are also present.

They eat a lot of food for although it is a simple fare it is delicious. They also drink a lot wine talk a lot to each other and even begin to sing.

They all forget about their own problems and troubles and just have a good time. ',Pakistan
' Question 4 Write about an event that makes you happy. Give reasons for your choice. ',Pakistan
' Answer The event that I like best in the novel is the rescue of King Rudolf V from his evil brother Duke of Michael. The King is held captive in The Prison of Zenda. Rudolf Rassendyll makes several attempts to rescue the King whereby in the end he is successful. I like this event because I thought that at least one of the Rudolfs would die in the story but this did not happen. Even though both of them are hurt in the process of saving the King the most important thing is both of them come out alive. ',Pakistan
' Question 5 Write about the episode that is memorable for you. Give evidences from the story. ',Pakistan
' Answer An episode which I find memorable in the story The Prisoner of Zenda  is when Rassendyll becomes Rudolf the V . This is when his own brother drugs the King and Rassendyll is persuaded to take the role of the King. This episode has an element of humor when Rassendyll is awakened by Sapt and Fritz with a bucket of water at five o clock in the morning. This episode also has suspense because Rassendyll Sapt and Fritz are to keep the secret of impersonation tight or it will be death for them if their secret is disclosed to the public. The element of love further makes this episode memorable whereby Rassendyll falls madly in love with Princess Flavia. However it comes to nothing because they have to part with each other in the end. ',Pakistan
' Question 6 Write about an event you wish had not happened. Give reasons for your choice. ',Pakistan
' Answer There are many events in the story but the only event I wish had not happened in this story is where Rassendyll kills a guard who is sleeping in a boat. Even though he does this in order to save King Rudolf it makes him look like a murderer and a coward. This is the only time he acts cowardly. At all other occasions he fights his enemy fairly and with courage. I wish he had not killed the man this way. ',Pakistan
' Question 7 Write about a sad event. Give example for your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer It is when Rudolf Rassendyll says his farewell to Princess Flavia after King Rudolf has been rescued. The King wants to keep Rudolf with him but Colonel Sapt and Marshall Strakencz do not let him because it was too dangerous. Therefore Rudolf has to leave Ruritania for good. He is tempted to take Princess Flavia with him but he knows that it is wrong of him because she is destined to marry the King and to serve her country. Before they part they express their love for each other and Princess Flavia gives her ring to Rudolf as a token of remembrance. It is really a touching and sad moment because they know that the moment they say good bye to each other they will never see each other again. ',Pakistan
' Question 8 Write about the most exciting part of the novel. ',Pakistan
' Answer Based on the story The Prisoner of Zenda  the most exciting part of the novel is when Rudolf Rassendyll is outside the old castle. It is late at night. He sees Rupert sneak into the castle. Then he hears screams from Antoinette and the sound of fighting coming from her room. The door of the castle opens and De Gautet appears and the two men fight. Rudolf kills De Gautet finds the keys on his dead body and enters the castle to rescue the King. He fights with the Duke s men and kills Bresonin.

' Question 9 Write about a place in which good things happen. Give reasons for your choice ',Pakistan
' Answer  The Prisoner of Zenda  is a novel about how Duke Michael tries to take over the throne from his brother King Rudolf V. In this novel many good things happen in the new town.

',Pakistan
' Question 10 Write about a place where bad things happen. Give reasons for your choice. ',Pakistan
' Answer The novel The Prisoner of Zenda  is a story about problems during the coronation of King Rudolf V. In this novel many bad things happen in the town of Zenda. Even though Rassendyll describes the countryside and the castle as beautiful places it is marred with too much violence and sadness. King Rudolf is captured and Is imprisoned by Duke Michael in the Prison of Zenda. There is a lot of fighting and killing in Zenda. Both Rassendyll and King Rudolf V are injured here. Black Michael is also killed in the fight with Rupert of Hentzau. Rassendyll and Princess Flavia also part with each other in Zenda. I think it is not a good place to stay. ',Pakistan
' MOREL VALUES Questions  ',Pakistan
' Question 1 Based on the novel that you have chosen write about the moral values from the story. Give examples for your choice. ',Pakistan
' Answer Some of the moral values found in the novel The Prisoner of Zenda  center on the evils of greed especially in the desire for power. The first moral value is One must not be greedy . In this story Black Michael is a symbol of greed. He is after the throne of Ruritania and is willing to go to great extent to fulfill his evil desire. He hires the Famous Six to kill his own brother King Rudolf V so that he can get the throne. He is also greedy in love. Even though he already has Antoinette de Mauban as his woman he still wants Princess Flavia as his wife. ',Pakistan
' The second moral value is We must help each other . Rassendyll agrees with the plan to impersonate the King because he feels that it is his duty as a human being to help people in distress. In his mission to save the King he gets great help from Colonel Sap Fritz and Antoinette de Mauban. Without these people s help the task of rescuing the King would surely be more complicated. ',Pakistan
' Question 2 Write about a moral value from the story. Give example to support your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer The moral value of the novel The Prisoner of Zenda  is one should be satisfied with one has and not to be greedy for more power. This value is what is lacking in Duke Michael. He has everything wealth position power status and the love of a beautiful woman Antoinette de Mauban. However he wants something more the throne and Princess Flavia. Such greed will not bring any good. It will bring ruin and the loss of innocent lives. Black Michael thinks he can buy anybody and kills anybody who stands in his way. In the end he himself is killed by his own man Rupert of Hentzau over a woman he does not want. Such an ending befits such greed and cruelty. ',Pakistan
' Question 3 Write about the most important lesson that you have learnt. Give example from the novel. ',Pakistan
' Answer I have learnt an important lesson from The Prisoner of Zenda . It is facing challenges with courage and a sense of adventure. Rassendyll knows the danger of impersonating the King. Yet he continues doing it to save the throne from Duke Michael. When he is successful in his mission to rescue the King the King is very grateful to him. Even when he falls very madly in love with Princess Flavia he knows that it is useless. However he accepts his fate with courage. If he had not taken the challenge of impersonating the King he would not have experienced these adventures. I have learnt that we must handle challenges with courage. ',Pakistan
' Question 4 What do you learn about loyalty in the novel  Give reasons to support your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer  The Prisoner of Zenda  has a message of loyalty for its reader. Colonel Sapt shows loyalty to his King.

' Question 5 What do you learn about determination  Give reasons to support your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer In the novel the Prisoner of Zenda  Rassendyll is determined to save the King. He pursues the villain Rupert even when he is injured because he is determined to punish Rupert. Rupert has killed Black Michael because he is determined to make Antoinette de Mauban his. Determination can be used to achieve negative as well as positive things. That is why we should think carefully about what we want to do with our lives. We can be noble like Rassendyll or evil like Rupert of Hentzau. Rupert is determined in a selfish and wicked way. ',Pakistan
' Question 6 Write about the value of courage. Give examples from the novel. ',Pakistan
' Answer  The Prisoner of Zenda  brings attention to the value of courage. Rudolf shows great courage in impersonating King Rudolf V. Later he tries to rescue the King from the castle. He has to fight with the King s enemies and wounded in doing so. The King is saved and his enemy Duke Michael and his followers are killed. Colonel Sapt and Fritz also display courage in helping Rudolf to rescue the King. Even Antoinette de Mauban shows a good example of courage in helping Rudolf. These characters really portray the value of courage. ',Pakistan
' Question 7 Based on the novel that you have chosen write about the value of generosity. Give examples from the story. ',Pakistan
' Answer  The Prisoner of Zenda  brings attention to the value of generosity. Rudolf Rassendyll acts generously towards King Rudolf V. He risks his life to rescue the King and even got wounded. King Rudolf and his throne are saved due to his generosity. While he is impersonating the King he falls in love with the King s fianc e Princess Flavia. She also loves him. However they act generously by sacrificing their love for the sake of the country and her duty. Both of them show their generosity by not being selfish. ',Pakistan
' THEMES Questions  ',Pakistan
' Question 1 Based on the novel The Prisoner of Zenda  write about two major themes of the story. Give examples for your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer The two major themes of the story are personal honor and public duty  and crime and punishment. ',Pakistan
' Personal Honor and Public Duty ',Pakistan
' Rassendyll after impersonating the King could have taken over the throne by letting the King be killed by his brother Duke Michael. He could also have taken the steps to marry Princess Flavia whom he had come to love so passionately. Rassendyl s sense of personal honour and public duty was so great that immediately after saving the King and his throne he left Princess Flavia and Ruritania for good. ',Pakistan
' Crime and Punishment. ',Pakistan
' The fate of the evil Black Michael brings us to the important theme of crime and punishment. When a serious crime has been committed the one who is directly responsible for it will eventually be punished in one way or the other. This is true when Duke Michael met his death at the hand of Rupert of Hentzau his own hired man. ',Pakistan
' OTHER THEMES ',Pakistan
' Theme of Loyalty ',Pakistan
' In the story The Prisoner of Zenda  we find the theme of loyalty throughout the whole novel. At the beginning of the novel we see how Colonel Sapt in his loyalty to the King suggests to Rassendyll the idea of disguising as the King so that Black Michael will not take the King s place. Later we read how Rassendyll Sapt and Fritz risk their lives to save the King from the castle. At the end of the story the King takes his rightful place on the throne because of the loyalty of these three men. ',Pakistan
' THEME OF HONOR ',Pakistan
' One theme from the novel The Prisoner of Zenda  is the honor must come first before love. Rudolf Rassendyll has shown loyalty when he puts the honor of defending the throne of Ruritania before his love for Princess Flavia. He has never taken advantage of his position to win the love of the Princess. He knows his first duty is to save the King and restore justice. In doing so he knows that he cannot be with Princess Flavia but he fights on. The theme is still relevant today. Honor must come first before personal love especially in situations where justice needs to be upheld and the fate of a nation is at stake. ',Pakistan
' THEME OF COURAGE ',Pakistan
' The theme of courage is well portrayed in The Prisoner of Zenda . Rassendyll shows great courage in impersonating King Rudolf V although he knows it is dangerous. Later he makes attempts to rescue the King from the clutches of his younger brother Duke Michael. He has to fight with the members of the Famous Six . Even though he is wounded he is satisfied with himself because he manages to save the King. Without Rassendyll s courage the King might lose his throne and Duke Michael would probably be the new King of Ruritania and marry his fianc e Princess Flavia. ',Pakistan
' THEME OF KINDNESS AND COMPASSION ',Pakistan
' The theme of kindness and compassion is well portrayed in The Prisoner of Zenda . Rassendyll Colonel Sapt and Fritz show compassion to King Rudolf V. When the King Is imprisoned by Duke Michael all the three of them make plans and attempts to rescue him. This is done at risk of death. They have no choice but to proceed with the plan because if they did not do so the King would surely die. The throne would then fall into the evil hands of Duke Michael. Due to their kindness and compassion everything is saved and things are back to normal again. ',Pakistan
' THEME OF SURVIVAL ',Pakistan
' The theme of survival is well portrayed in The Prisoner of Zenda . King Rudolf Is kept prisoner in the castle by his half brother Duke Michael. However as long as Rudolf Rassendyll impersonates the King the King s life is spared. Knowing this Rassendyll continues to be the imposter. Rassendyll shows strong survival skills by playing his role well even though he faces countless hardships. Any wrong move means death. He later fights with the King s enemies and manages to rescue the King. ',Pakistan
' GOOD AGAINST EVIL ',Pakistan
' In the novel The Prisoner of Zenda we have the theme of good against evil. There is a struggle for power between King Rudolf V and Duke Michael who are brothers. King Rudolf is the rightful ruler of Ruritania but Duke Michael wants to be King. Duke Michael s greed for power pushes him to kill his brother so that he can take over the throne. Duke Michael sends the King a bottle of drugged wine so that the King cannot attend his coronation. Later Josef is killed and the King is captured and imprisoned by Duke Michael. Duke Michael even tries to buy off Rassendyll with a hundred thousand pounds to leave Ruritania. In the end good triumphs over evil as Duke Michael dies and King Rudolf is saved. ',Pakistan
' COMPARISON Questions  ',Pakistan
' Question 1 Compare and contrast two characters from the novel  The Prisoner of Zenda . Give evidence from the story to support your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer In the novel  The Prisoner of Zenda  by Anthony Hope I would choose to compare Rudolf Rassendyll and Duke Michael. Both Rassendyll and Duke Michael are brave men but Rassendyll has shown his courage positively to fight for the King and the country. He risks and sacrifices his life without even caring for himself in order to save the King. He is a loyal responsible and honorable man. Knowing that he has to return the throne to the rightful King he does not act out of selfishness and greed. He even sacrifices his love for Princess Flavia and gives her up for the sake of her duty and responsibility to Ruritania. ',Pakistan
' Duke Michael on the other hand is an evil man. He is blinded by greed and he wants to possess not only the throne but also Princess Flavia. He acts out harshly out of hatred and stoops low enough even to kidnap his own brother King Rudolf V. He betrays not only his family but also his country and is even ready to have the King killed in order for him to be crowned as the King of Ruritania. In the end he was killed by his own greed. ',Pakistan
' This novel allows me to see the differences between the values and nature of two men from a very clear aspect. I have been able to distinguish the two characters and see the good and bad sides of them. ',Pakistan
' Question 2 Compare and contrast two characters from the novel  The Prisoner of Zenda  based on the theme  love . Support your answer with evidence from the novel. ',Pakistan
' Answer I choose to compare Rudolf Rassendyll and King Rudolf V from the novel  The Prisoner of Zenda . When it comes to love Rudolf Rassendyll shows the genuine love and affection towards Princess Flavia. He is caring and is full of love for her. Princess Flavia herself feels it and mentions it when the two of them were alone. King Rudolf V on the other hand loves Princess Flavia out of duty. She is to be the Queen of Ruritania and they are destined to be together with or without love. It is their responsibility to be wedded as they have to win the peoples  trust and live up to their expectations. King Rudolf has always been cold and quiet whenever the two of them are together. ',Pakistan
' In terms of  love towards the country  Rudolf Rassendyll not being a Ruritanian himself has shown great effort and courage in ensuring that the throne is returned to the rightful king. He fights bravely to save the King s life in order to restore peace and harmony to the country. King Rudolf on the other hand does not show enough positive qualities to prove his love to his own homeland. He is often drunk and thus ignores his duty and sets a negative image to the people. ',Pakistan
' Question 3 Write about an incident that changes the life of a character. Give evidence to support your answer. ',Pakistan
' Answer The incident that changes the life of Rudolf Rassendyll is when he is asked to impersonate the King of Ruritania whom he resembles. The King is drugged and cannot attend the coronation. This particular incident changes Rudolf Rassendyll from a good for nothing into a man who is responsible loyal brave and sincere. He carries the role as the King with dignity never once fooling anyone. Although he is in a position of power where he can own everything he remains loyal to the King. He helps to search for the King who is kidnapped and shows extraordinary courage in the face of adversity. ',Pakistan
' Question 4 Write about the setting of the novel  The Prisoner of Zenda . Give information from the novel to support your answer.  ',Pakistan
' Answer The story of  The Prisoner of Zenda  is set in the nineteenth century. The story begins in the home of Lord Burlesdon Rudolf Rassendyll s elder brother. Then the place setting changes to follow Rudolf Rassendyll the main character as he travels to Ruritania for a holiday. Most of the actions in the story take place in Ruritania an imaginary country in Europe. Important places and locations in the story include the hunting lodge in Zenda where the King is held captive. Strelsau is the place where Rudolf Rassendyll is crowned the  King  and first meets Princess Flavia and Duke Michael ',Pakistan
' Question 5 Write about an important place of location in the story  The Prisoner of Zenda . Support your answer with information from the novel.  ',Pakistan
' Answer An important location in the story of  The Prisoner of Zenda  is the Castle of Zenda. The Castle of Zenda is situated on a hilltop surrounded by forest. It consists of the Old Castle and the New Castle. The Old Castle is ancient but well preserved. It is surrounded by a moat with a drawbridge across it. On the other side of the drawbridge is the New Castle which serves as a country house for Duke Michael. The New Castle is the place where Duke Michael is killed by Rupert of Hentzau following their quarrel over Antoinette de Mauban. The Old Castle is the place where Duke Michael holds King Rudolf V captive. ',Pakistan
' Question 6 Does the title  The Prisoner of Zenda  is relevant to the novel  ',Pakistan
' Answer  The title  The Prisoner of Zenda  is relevant to the novel. The story is about the king of Ruritania who is imprisoned by his evil brother Duke Michael in Zenda castle. Rudolf Rassendyll who bears a striking resemblance to King Rudolf V impersonated the king. While Rudolf Rassendyll is playing the part of the King King Rudolf V is becoming very ill in prison. Rudolf Rassendyl risks his life to rescue the king who gets back his throne. ',Pakistan

'  Super puff  planet unlike any other found in deep space could change how we explore the universe ',Pakistan
' Scientists have confirmed the existence of a massive super puff  exoplanet one that is as large as Jupiter but 10 times lighter and could change how humanity explores the universe. ',Pakistan
' The planet known as WASP 107b was first found in 2017 but it wasn t until recently that astronomers were able to confirm its low density putting it into the cotton candy  or super puff  category. ',Pakistan
' For WASP 107b the most plausible scenario is that the planet formed far away from the star where the gas in the disc is cold enough that gas accretion can occur very quickly  the study s lead author Caroline Piaulet said in a statement. The planet was later able to migrate to its current position either through interactions with the disc or with other planets in the system.  ',Pakistan
' Artistic rendition of the exoplanet WASP 107b and its star WASP 107. Some of the star s light streams through the exoplanet s extended gas layer.  Credit  ESA HUBBLE NASA M. KORNMESSER  ',Pakistan
' WASP 107b orbits the WASP 107 star system which is 211 light years from Earth. A light year which measures distance in space is approximately 6 trillion miles. ',Pakistan
' WASP 107b is exceptionally close to its star taking just 5.7 days to orbit its star 16 times closer than Earth is to the sun. It also has a low density as it s believed 85  of its mass is in the layer of gas around its core. When combined these facts left astronomers with a lot of unanswered questions. ',Pakistan
' We had a lot of questions about WASP 107b  Piaulet added. How could a planet of such low density form  And how did it keep its huge layer of gas from escaping especially given the planet s close proximity to its star  This motivated us to do a thorough analysis to determine its formation history.  ',Pakistan
' By contrast Jupiter is significantly more massive has a core believed to comprise 5  to 15  of its total mass and is significantly further away from the sun than WASP 107b is from its star. ',Pakistan
' It s possible that WASP 107b was once in a very different place in its star system given that it is evaporating. ',Pakistan
' For WASP 107b the most plausible scenario is that the planet formed far away from the star where the gas in the disc is cold enough that gas accretion can occur very quickly  study co author and astronomer Eve Lee noted. The planet was later able to migrate to its current position either through interactions with the disc or with other planets in the system.  ',Pakistan
' During their observations of WASP 107b the researchers also discovered another planet in the system WASP 107c. This planet is very different from WASP 107b with an oval orbit and it takes 1088 days to go around the host star. ',Pakistan
' WASP 107b will give new insight into how gas giants form and provide new clues that Jupiter and Saturn aren t able to. ',Pakistan
' Exoplanets like WASP 107b that have no analog in our Solar System allow us to better understand the mechanisms of planet formation in general and the resulting variety of exoplanets  Piaulet explained. It motivates us to study them in great detail.  ',Pakistan
' More than 4000 exoplanets have been discovered by NASA in total approximately 50 of which were believed to potentially be habitable as of September 2018. They have the right size and the right orbit of their star to support surface water and at least theoretically to support life. ',Pakistan

' The Unforgettable Farmhouse ',Pakistan
' This week on homify we are travelling to Morbihan France to discover a remarkable farmhouse renovation that showcases style as well as energy efficiency. The interior designer Ludovic Cadoret is originally from the region and has invested in the rehabilitation of this building. Formed from a single common room the home initially housed people at one end and animals at the other. One can easily imagine the difficulty in providing sufficient insulation for this type of space together with the challenges posed by such a large undertaking. ',Pakistan
' With an imposing size the area to be heated was immense. Warmth was generated using geothermal power through a borehole. The gable of the building faces south allowing the roof to be utilised to optimise the energy savings within the new dwelling. Through the designer s firm Ludo Concept Design many projects have been rehabilitated and renovated throughout western France. Here today we see a gorgeous project where the team have really outdone themselves. This iconic habitat traditionally inhabited by small farmers and artisans has been totally transformed and refurbished. To see the home and take an exclusive tour of this impressive renovation project check out the images below. This dwelling is truly a sustainable and environmentally responsible approach to home renovation. ',Pakistan
' Substantial dimensions ',Pakistan
' In the past thanks to the proximity of animals the home could be heated naturally. Of course this offered plenty of disadvantages that one can easily imagine  ',Pakistan
' The challenge was therefore to isolate the original structure insulate it and prevent heat loss. Realising the difficulty of the task as well as seeing the size of the building required highly astute skills from the architects and designers. By drilling into the ground of the property the architects were able to establish a highly cost effective geothermal system. The heat is then diffused into the rest of the dwelling by a hydraulic floor. ',Pakistan
' Glass castle ',Pakistan
' Located near Vannes this former farmhouse was an extremely large scale project which has totally transformed a run down property into comfortable and eco friendly house. A striking view we love this beautiful all glass fa ade that contrasts perfectly with the original cut stone structure. ',Pakistan
' This glass palace looks like it could be straight out of the Wizard of Oz with the old structure having undergone a number of developments. Without further ado let s look at some of the changes made to this glorious Breton barn. ',Pakistan
' Huge breakthrough ',Pakistan
' By viewing this house from the side one can better appreciate the unusual dimensions of the building and its long linear form. The energy contribution has been optimized and a breakthrough design employs many skylights in the roofspace allowing natural light to penetrate the building and therefore better warm the interior spaces. ',Pakistan
' Located due south the gable of the building is a distinct characteristic of the project and was expertly utilised for the ecological bioclimatic properties it offers. Looking like a gigantic solar panel the flaps of the roof store solar energy for heating the home and warm the interior like a natural radiator. Furthermore the rounded roof features add elegance and are a typical feature of this kind of rural housing. ',Pakistan
' Majestic ',Pakistan
' As we can see the interior spaces beautifully highlight the generous living areas within the building a main characteristic for the project. ',Pakistan
' Forming a sort of envelope natural stone structures host the various living spaces that have been designed according to the panorama of the external environment. The huge window replacing the gable wall gives way to incredible perspectives and invites the surrounding countryside into the heart of the house. We realise that the ceiling height has been tamed with the addition of another level which is comparable to a huge mezzanine. The area is thereby multiplied paying tribute to this vast and majestic space. ',Pakistan
' Heart of the house ',Pakistan
' Modern and minimalist the kitchen opens up to the rest of the space and is organised around a central island. The kitchen island is the ideal place to lean up against as an informal dining table or as a bar for a drink with friends. The clean lines work beautifully with the pristine white lacquered joinery which gives a futuristic and conceptual feeling to the kitchen. ',Pakistan
' A simple functional bright uncluttered modern kitchen sets the scene and takes us into the contemporary cocoon within the house. ',Pakistan
' Let s fly between floors ',Pakistan
' Like floating into the air the steps of the staircase are formed with an ultra graphic steel structure that invites us to fly between the floors. Modern and elegant the lines of the staircase add to the overall impression of the space and look both refined as well as sophisticated. ',Pakistan
' The staircase captures an unfolding space over two levels and gives us an impression of the magnitude of the work undertaken and of the volume of the house. ',Pakistan
' Beautiful from above ',Pakistan
' Here in this image we are situated on the floor under the triangular window arch characteristic of this type of building. Of particular note is the double height space produced by the steel frame which also allows a feeling of liveability and comfort. The beams are also painted in a white hue enhancing the original structure. From here the view to the surrounding area is both striking and picturesque and we can easily imagine a room or office with panoramic views of Morbihan. ',Pakistan

' About Us ',Pakistan
' Town Hall or Lahore Metropolitan Corporation Hall is located on the west at junction of Upper and Lower Mall Roads. Originally built as Victoria Jubilee Town Hall dedicated to the joyful memory of the fiftieth year of the reign of Queen Victoria the building was begun in February 1887. Its foundation stone was laid by Charles Aitchison Lieut. Governor of the Punjab and the opening took place with great fanfare and ceremony attended by Prince Albert Victor on February 3 1890. ',Pakistan
' This structure although not very large has an impressive presence. Consisting of two storeys it has a large hall 80  x 40  wide on the first floor while the ground floor is dedicated to offices. As was usual with town halls of the British period the beautifully decorated hall with its excellent teak floor was used for exclusive functions such as dances concerts and meetings although the prince in his opening speech said that he hoped that it would also be utilized for wise and quiet debates. ',Pakistan
' As a result of a competition the winning design with a prize of Rs. 500 was chosen from several competitive entries. The design was prepared by Pogson a Madras architect. Having been designed on an oriental principle as noted in contemporary accounts the building incorporates elements derived from Muslim architectural traditions. The square corner towers are the dominating element of the ensemble and incorporate arch forms from varied sources Mughal and Sultanate Period lancet arches along with Spanish horse shoe arches reflect the influence of Robert Fellows Chisholm of Madras rather than that of Swinton Jacob of Jaipur. The choice of Pogson demonstrates the partiality felt for Madras by the Lahore Administration they having earlier chosen the design of another Madras architect J.W. Brassington for the impressive Chief Court  High Court  building. ',Pakistan
' The two storey middle section of the building carrying an enormous lancet arch alcove is flanked by the massive three storey corner towers the roof line terminating with castle like merlons. The corner towers are capped by a central dome and four onion shaped corner cupolas. In spite of its  oriental  imagery and use of moldings the detailing is comparatively simple and the flourish of molded brick or terra cotta fretwork found in the earlier Chief Court or the nearby Mayo School is not in evidence. ',Pakistan
' The building which was completed at a cost of Rs. 60000 has been restored and cleaned in recent years and once again proudly presents its original brick facing. The landscaped forecourt is dominated by an attractive fountain said to be a gift of Raja Harbans Singh. ',Pakistan

' We are in Transylvania and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things.  These words from Bram Stoker s Dracula echo in my head as the train slowly grinds out of Bucharest s Nord station. I am no Jonathan Harker the solicitor who visits Count Dracula in Stoker s finest creation. Unlike Harker I know exactly what I m headed into. It has been a lifelong dream of mine to visit the land of one of the most feared characters in both real and imaginary history  Transylvania is the place where the blood thirsty Vlad the Impaler defended Wallachia from the Turks and subsequently ended up in Western literature as a blood thirsty vampire. But first a word about Bucharest and its communist architecture supernova  only second to the Pentagon as the biggest in the world Bucharest s Palace of the Parliament will need your widest angle lens. A chain smoking bartender and I discuss the fact that Romania actually recognises witchcraft as a tax paying profession and that 10000 people get bitten by stray dogs in the city every year   stories as perfect as gymnast Nadia Com neci s 10. Even the scoreboard didn t expect her  the bartender puffs. It s true  the scoreboard at the 1976 Montreal Olympics didn t have space for the gymnast s 10.00 so registered a confusing 1.00. Such is the tenacity of Romanians   literally  citizens of Rome . ',Pakistan

' Winter is everywhere and I exit Bucharest armed with plenty of the local weapon of choice  plum brandy. Heading into the heart of Transylvania   much like a wooden stake would   the frozen flat ground gives way to rugged mountains dotted with snow and tree branches reaching out welcoming you with their skeletal arms. This is a beautiful country  villages seem locked in time bull carts still transporting hay the way they did 400 years ago. My first stop is the fairytale town of Sinaia named after a 17th century monastery home to the first Romanian Bible. The town is all pretty chimney turrets and bean soup smoke and it feels like somebody chucked a box of pastel coloured crayons into a cement mixer as I trek up the hill through narrow alleyways in order to get to the fantastic Neo Renaissance Peles Castle. Brasov an hour s journey by train from Sinaia is my base for this region. It s a little more modern but has heart as if to make up for the McDonalds near the old town. The city offers me a splendid sight the first morning I draw my curtains and look out the window  the head of a stuffed deer resting in a horse carriage staring right back at me. I head towards the nearby town of Bran which boasts the famed  Dracula Castle . Links to the actual Count himself are not confirmed but it is local knowledge that Vlad was imprisoned here for a while. Nevertheless the castle is just as Stoker describes it on the overcast day I choose to visit on the very edge of a terrific precipice . ',Pakistan

' Unlike for Harker none of the doors are locked to me here. I wander around the castle learning more about Vlad the Impaler. In a time when conquerors and despots would battle for the title of the most imaginative sadist he was hands down the winner. True to his nickname Vlad used to impale entire platoons of Turkish soldiers onto sharpened wooden stakes and leave them to rot over a couple of days while gravity slowly slid them inch by inch further down the spike. A fierce fighter Vlad Dracula   son of the Order of the Dragon   dracul  in Romanian adding an  a  means  son of     stood up against the Ottoman Empire s expansion into Wallachia and is thus still considered a hero around here. Vlad wasn t one for manners. When the Ottoman Sultan sent messengers to collect tax from the Count they refused to remove their turbans to show respect. Vlad let them know that they would never remove them again  he had the turbans nailed to the messengers  heads. Despite this reputation Vlad was far from a vampire in a black cloak  he certainly didn t climb down his castle wall like a gecko. Nor I suspect did he shrink in the face of garlic. His is a classic accident of literature colliding with history creating one of the most fearful and repulsive characters read by man. My jugular intact I walk past the large tombstone in the grounds around the castle wondering how the Irish Bram Stoker who never visited Transylvania managed to craft such an eloquent   although unfairly horrific   description of this countryside. Finally dismayed that the three Ladies of the Castle didn t make a visit this time round as they did for Harker I head back to Brasov. ',Pakistan

' My next stop is the 12th century dreamscape city of Sighi oara further into Transylvania. A magnificent gothic clock tower guards over this pretty town that has more colour on its walls than a paint fight in a kindergarten. But the real draw for me is one particular yellow house tucked in the shadow of the clock tower  the residence of the Dracul family where the Count was raised. It is as bright as Vlad was full of darkness. These days the building houses a restaurant complete with a ma tre d  in a red and black cloak. If you visit do the right thing and order your steak bloody. Around the corner from the house is a solitary statue. Sporting a Javed Miandad like moustache Vlad Tepes   tepes  in Romanian means  impaler   looks solemn as stone cold as he is in the book. His was a life full of dispensing cruelty and yet he met an end that was sweeter than most  his decapitated head was presented to the Sultan in Constantinople preserved in a jar of the finest Wallachian honey. Stoker s vampire is the undead monster who rises night after night for eternity and haunts all who know him. In writing Dracula Stoker provided Vlad exactly that  eternal life. The book has never been out of print and continues to be one of the most quoted horror stories among young and old readers. Vlad Dracula wouldn t have wanted it any other way. As the countryside flies past my train window on my ride back I notice the Carpathian mountains shrinking and I remember the meaningful words the Count says to Harker as the Englishman enters the castle. Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely  and leave something of the happiness you bring.  Ali Rez has visited 92 countries. His goal is to visit all of them.

' Where in Bhong  ',Pakistan
' Traveling through Pakistan countryside away from the main highways it is best to keep remember that petrol stations are few and far between on relatively deserted roads. Also the road drive slowly and keep close to the edge of your road when encountering large trucks. Watch out for animals transport and animals on the road. Be sure your motor vehicle is roadworthy. You do not want to suffer a breakdown anywhere back o  Bourke ie away from civilization. Or else be ready to what happened to us while going to see the mosque in Bhong. ',Pakistan
' After having famous  Doodh Mesu  from a hotel in Sadiq Abad we turned off the Road towards village Bhong. In the areas as the harvest approaches the traveller especially in the irrigated tracts ride through endless expanses of waving crops of different shades of colour out of which the villages seem to rise like islets in an ocean of green. After the harvest all is changed  the dull brown of the fields is relieved by the trees solitary or in groves and avenues and by the hamlets and village ponds. Or one sees the haystacks and threshers kicking off dust. ',Pakistan
' The modern demographic trends are changing the relations between rural and urban areas. Insufficient infrastructure non existing civic services and lack of opportunities in rural areas have increased rural to urban migration. There is a lack of human capacity in the Punjabi villages in general. ',Pakistan
' Bhong Mosque is famous the world over. Late Rais Ghazi Mohammad the direct descendent of Abbasi family of Bahawalpur and landlord of a large estate began the mosque project in 1932 in Bhong village the most important of the scattered villages on his vast property. The mosque was to be the most glorious building in his palace compound which also included a smaller mosque a madrasa and rooms for students. ',Pakistan
' The work of specialists gathered from all over Pakistan and India  master masons and craftsmen from Rajasthan calligraphers and painters from Karachi  the compound was designed and constructed over a period of nearly 50 years. And it is. Broadly assorted in their use of sources the builders have combine stylistic elements from Lahore as well as Iran Spain and Turkey and combined them with almost all known elements of the time. Materials and crafts used range from the traditional  teak ivory marble coloured glass onyx glazed tile work fresco mirror work gilded tracery ceramic calligraphic work and inlay  to the modern and synthetic  marbleised industrial tile artificial stone facing terrazzo coloured cement tile and wrought iron . Only traditional materials were used in the mosque interiors. Gold leaves have been used for the intricate decorative work in the mosque which has made it famous. It is a site worth visiting for its beauty and the stylish calligraphic work. ',Pakistan
' The Bhong Mosque stands on a majestic citadel like a pearl. It is a part of a complex that consists of a prayer hall library a madrasa and residential dormitories for students and visitors. The complex is utilized by the local population. The madrasa is functional although with less importance than in the past when students came to the school from as far as Turkey Afghanistan and Iran. ',Pakistan
' Bhong Mosque received the Aga Khan International Award for Architecture in 1986. In the words of the jury  Bhong  Mosque  enshrines and epitomises the popular taste in Pakistan with all its vigour pride tension and sentiment. Its use and misuse of signs and symbols expresses appropriate growing pains of architecture in transition.  Earlier the shrine of Shah Rukn e Alam was given the prestigious Aga Khan award. The Tughlaq built shrine marks the climax of Multani architecture and is surprisingly original. ',Pakistan
' Since conference of award the Mosque has become a site of interest for architects from all over the world. To many architects and intellectuals the Bhong Mosque complex is a product that negates the very purpose of an architectural enterprise rooted in the deep understanding of the culture  writes steering committee member and architect Ismail Serageldin. To many others it is a wonderful exuberant structure that evokes an almost palpable joie de vivre and that represents a bow to the prevailing taste of its users  stated  along with the majority s final thoughts and statements  by Hans Hollein and the Turkish architect Mehmet Doruk Pamir in their work. Much more have been written by the international architectural press about the mosque that is a thing of beauty. ',Pakistan
' The Aga Khan International Award for Architecture established in 1977 by His Highness the Aga Khan recognises examples of architectural excellence that encompass contemporary design social housing community improvement and development restoration re use and area conservation as well as landscaping and environmental issues. Through its efforts the Award seeks to identify and encourage building concepts that successfully address the needs and aspirations of societies in which Muslims have a significant presence. The award enhances the understanding and appreciation of Islamic culture as expressed through architecture. Through its efforts the Award seeks to identify and encourage building concepts that successfully address the needs and aspirations of societies in which Muslims have a significant presence. ',Pakistan
' Beyond the architectural wonder and potential for development of pollution free serene and quite sleepy place the village is a dwelling where farmers live like rustic in the face of modern urban attractions and in the state of total neglect. Main bazaar is lined with modest shops selling meat sweets fresh vegetables and other commodity items. There are few hotels. Sturdy tonga is the vehicle of convenience here for going to and coming from place to place. But the moment some automobile passes through the bazaar it kicks thick clouds of dust that keep hanging for some time before it settles on eatables on sale in the open. ',Pakistan
' Tractors Suzuki pickups and small tucks are edging out animal drawn carts seen roaming on the dusty trails and tracks of rural Pakistan now. But animal power can not be written off in and around Bhong village. Bullocks donkeys horses and camels drawn carts still move large quantity of freight in rural areas  as well as cities . They go where trucks can not go  they are cheap  they are invaluable when speed is not important. They have not outlived their utility so they will be with us for at least another 50 years. ',Pakistan
' Similarly agricultural implements like axes  hatches shackles and ploughs produced by village lohar  blacksmith  are being replaced by modern farming machinery. The tradesmen like lohar tarkhan  carpenter  nai  barber  and darzi  tailor  traditionally working in the villages since centuries   mostly paid in the form of grain at the end of each rabi and kharif seasons   are no more pursuing their vocations. They are putting their children in schools for education instead And without the agricultural land holding it is easier for these tradesmen to shift to the cities. But the Bhong Mosque will stay there for ever for people to come and see. ',Pakistan
' It is on our way back that only seven kilometers from the National Highway engine of our vehicle  RKR Toyota Jeep  coughed and died down. Driver opened the bonnet fiddled around some and gave a blank look. Every one else also tried to figure out what has happened but no results till Captain Jamal pointed out that we should also check the petrol level. That was it. The driver was sent to get the petrol with empty container hanging at the back of the vehicle on a local bus who came after one and half hour. And while waiting under a shady tree we had a cribbing and bickering session. ',Pakistan
' 1 thought on Where in Bhong   ',Pakistan
' I wanna comment on the family and descend of the Late Sardar Rais Ghazi Muhammad of BHONG.He Belongs to INDHAR clan the Sub Clan of famous Bhatti Rajputs and his family came from Jaisalmer and settled here.Sohe is not an Abbassi and this is a fact not a theory. ',Pakistan
