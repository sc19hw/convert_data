# Introduction

  This is a python script that I use to do data processing on a TXT file that I downloaded from SketchEngine.    
  
  It consists of two parts:  
  
  [convert.py](convert.py) is used to remove labels such as p tag. And then add ", "and the corresponding country name in every word or sentence on the line.  
  
  [delete.py](delete.py) ts used to remove all special characters except commas and quotes.  
***  
The rest five txt files are the result of the resolution.  

And the [corpus.csv](corpus.csv) file is the final result after I combined the five TXT files and modified the format.
