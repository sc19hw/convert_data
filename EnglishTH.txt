He received the new Japanese Ambassador Ryuji Takeuzhi. Eilat In the Middle East are emerging more crises. The State of Israel which wants to transform the port of Eilat at the vertex of the Gulf of Aqaba into a naval base is again facing a difficult problem provided. Saudi Arabia considered waters of the Gulf and wants to block the passage of Israeli ships at gunpoint.

For half a century the demonic images of visionary art were born in this room. What lives in them is the terror and horror history who far rushed ahead our time to To find a terrible confirmation in the fact of the experienced present. In the black and white brilliant stroke of the pen Kubin has found the form and the formula of his art. Fascinated by the specter of his century he conjures up as man and as ban artists. Beauty is beauty is Trump recognized also the new Republicans from Ghana and sent their beauty queen on a friendship tour to London. The Englishman inherently know what deserves a Queen and so they sought warm heart to the blessings of civilization of the dark skinned beauty everywhere endeavours. How richly blessed is the tenth German Federal State with beauties which proved the excretion of the opal works for the election of Miss Saarbr cken in Saarbr cken Germany. The Saarland capital wanted to not bring discredit and sent a fine selection of avatar applicants in the fight to win the favor of the audience. The large sell off of beauty ended with the victory of a small vendor. It is called Helga Drosse and is for their 18 years in very good shape. Dazzling in form Germany s biceps matadors in the Mannheimer Muse Hall were Marathon of muscle. With a much younger team she participated to the international competition of muscles against France. The most impressive performance offered the lightweight Willi Kolb. With 115 kilograms he set a new German record in the two terms. But also the French did play their forces. The third Olympics Jean Debuf won in the Mittelschwergewicht. With a total of 24175 kilograms the French result by 30 kilograms was lighter than the weight the German team   brought to the high line. Thereby our muscle Prince celebrated a powerful success. A sensation on the trotting course weather enthusiastic Italians at the big lottery prize of Agnano experienced trotting sensation in Agnano. The French record holder Gelinotte is favored. Checco PRA and Assisi To give a brief Intermezzo as a front runner. But a horse from midfield dissolves after a few meters. Irresistible it passes on his rival. The followers of the Favorites are disappointed. It is namely not Gelinotte it is the 5 outsiders Tornese which the Sulky veteran Mario Santi imposes on a murderous trot. Yet is not all days evening. The experts talk about a waste of power. Until the final Sprint will prove it. And there s even Gelinotte. On the inside Lane she takes on the track. But her attack comes too late. Tornese WINS and once again ensures the good reputation of the unpopular outsider. Berlin football final country fighting mood of the 80000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium in the play off for the Berlin football championship between Hertha BSC  white shirts  and tennis Borussia. The game isn t even two minutes old when following a corner falls 1 0 to Hertha. A quarter of an hour later the Hertha storm is skillfully in the game brought. Powerful Faeder prevails against two defenders and completed a 2 0. After halftime the benefits clearly Hertha s page are. The Elf from the Gesundbrunnen dangerously harassed the sanctuary of the violet. A few counterattacks of the Borussia remain the fate of Borussias without resounding success the 50th minute sealed. Dove no. 8 takes a template to a 3 0 over the line. So Hertha BSC becomes 16. Male Berlin Championship and participates in the games for the German Championship. Fairy night along the Seine for a few hours sank the bitter reality of our days in a fairytale night along the Seine when Queen Elizabeth ascended to the ceremonial barge Borde Fretigny.

Klaus Roger Horst and Arno brought their village in the talk. They formed a pop band and called themselves the Petards   the firecrackers and succeeded in what remains the most provincial bands denied  she made a breakthrough into the national music scene. And what them almost as much was worth  she reconciled the conservative villagers with the new sound from her Bach of Schreck. The telephone  a news and communication device today for everyone. It began its triumphal March 100 years ago. Old phones from the beginning of the third bear witness in the museums of the Deutsche Bundespost.

It is the largest service provider in Europe. Many letters and postcards are now automatically stamped and sorted. The daily deluge of 32 million items of correspondence forces to the use of machines. Electronics and automation can also help distribute packages. The post transported approximately 270 million units in the year. With nearly 500000 employees and a budget that is nearly a quarter of the federal budget the post is an important economic factor.

Screen text and data transmission  the news technology of tomorrow has already begun. You increase the range of services. In spite of technological progress the post will carry always letters   to the remotest corners. This is possible only with human resources today   and tomorrow if the memory has faded of the beginnings of the communication. Ludwigsburg Palace a monument of the Baroque in the South of the Federal Republic and one of the largest castle in Germany. The Herzog von W rttemberg has let it build at the beginning of the 18th century. It reflects the personal representation joy of its inhabitants and the urge of the former royal houses to external power and magnificence. The huge garden is an architectural part of the palace complex. He is not preserved in its original state but was created 25 years ago in the baroque spirit after studying old templates  with Lakes fountains flowerbeds and avenues. The huge garden flourishing Baroque   with this promise attracts many thousands of visitors every summer. A complex system requiring constant and meticulous care to present themselves in that State which may have once been the purpose  as a shop window and mirror of an era in which a few powerful many subjects deems ruled. And like humans so they ordered also the nature. The Federal Republic of Germany otherwise a strike poor country experienced violent labor disputes in recent weeks. The reason  new technologies especially the electronics penetrate faster and faster in many sectors of the economy and change the quality of many jobs or make them superfluous. On the other hand modern technology is necessary to streamline so that competitiveness is not lost. You will create new jobs. There was the toughest labor dispute in the printing industry. Here the electronics threatened an entire profession  the typesetter. These skilled workers with strike fought for their jobs. Only emergency newspapers in Germany published for days on end. Lead fitters work according to tradition  produce the letters for the print templates in the machine or hand set. This technique remained unchanged since the invention of the printing press more than 500 years ago in principle. Now the lead of the electronics need to be different. Computer controlled text systems replace the ancient art of the typesetter. Before the screen sit the journalists themselves or only skilled typists and type the text into the computer. The results are final proofs from which the break editor composed the templates for the pages of the newspaper. The final artwork is then made in the light set procedure. The social consequences of this technology are now has been absorbed by a new collective agreement  on the display screen equipment typesetter are employed in the longer term primarily their previously obtained earnings is guaranteed them for their entire working life. And other professionals are trained to without any loss of income. Maximilian Horngacher the man who brings wood to the blades. Soloists and orchestral musicians from around the world call him the master of his Guild. In his small workshop in Munich he builds the harps that carry his name 14 16 year. With 5 employees he creates the 2400 items of a harp in hand work and then adds them together. Half a year passes by to cutting wood up to the voices of the finished instrument. The harp Maker uses 5 types of wood including maple mahogany and beech. The wood must be stored and dried be. Because the strings are later pull with a force of 2000 kg on the frame. The trains tongues pedals the entire mechanism together with the threads and screw is made in the workshop. Precision is everything for an instrument which must retain its sound quality in the tropics and in cold northern countries. When the harp body inlaid with gold leaf is decorated the strings are indented. The finished instrument is played by a professional harpist.

" 01 together against terror for these men is shooting not the first but the very last option. Then of course they have to be perfect. Because the enemy is treacherous and unconscionable  international terrorism. The German counter terrorism unit GSG 9 exercises on its own premises near the German capital Bonn. The helicopter sets down a battle group which is to build a roadblock. Only what time and time again is trained can lead to success in the real thing under difficult circumstances still unknown places. The men of the GSG 9 have everything from fast cars with own helicopter of up to state of the art wireless technology and partly new weapons. Here sample the real thing not soldiers but police officers are. Their task is to protect people s lives and to hand over terrorists to justice. These men and their comrades were s that liberated in the Jahre 1977 in Mogadishu Somalia the passengers of Lufthansa aircraft unscathed from the violence of terrorist hostage takers. Since then the special unit of the Federal Police is an example for similar brigades in many countries. GSG 9 founder Colonel Wegener which is 6000 kilometres from Germany away against terrorists won is world s sought after expert. This force ready to use within minutes shows that Germany will give the terror in cooperation with other Western democracies don t stand a chance. 02. people in their folk customs accompany the spring Customs may 1 since time immemorial   we re in Upper Bavaria. This 30 metre FIR should be the Maypole of Hohenpei enberg village. Especially in the countryside the setting up of the maypole is still living tradition. Vigil at the camp fire. The young men who get the Maypole from the forest according to the old tradition watching him the whole night. Because it is also the custom that the men of the neighboring village trying to kidnap the Maypole. Says to be on guard. Some people who too forcefully spoke to the warming brandy cooler night found themselves at dawn without the Maypole. In the forest near Hohenpei enberg everything has gone well. Now the maypole is driven by the place. It s the day before May 1. Everything is on the legs. The tree is festively decorated in the colours of Bavaria   white and blue. The tradition requires that on the horizontal Struts that now abundance give the tree instead of the branches the old character of the craft and business establishments are attached to the place. And then the most difficult piece begins working at the fairground in Hohenpei enberg. Under the critical eyes of wives and girlfriends the men set up the Maypole. Now comes the fun. Like this the dance begins in many places in Germany in May. Even the smallest would not miss this tradition. 03. environmental protection in power plants the area between the Western German cities of Cologne and Aachen is one of the power centers of the Federal Republic. In the biggest open pit mining of the world brown coal is funded and burned in power plants which are right on the edge of the pits to produce electric current. But Brown coal is a difficult fuel   with many harmful additives. The calorific value is lower than the fire burn the coal with 1200 degrees Celsius. A such power plant environmental impact particularly strongly with two harmful exhaust gases  sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The German Government wants to protect human beings and nature. With the strictest laws in the world operators stop   these are not only power plants   by large industrial furnaces for the environmental protection. The brown coal power plant Neurath. The filter systems which here partly finished some are under construction occupy almost as much space as the entire existing power plant. Engineers and construction workers compared to the system look like dwarfs. Already interested parties from many countries come to learn about the world s leading environmental technology. Making clean particularly pollutant rich brown coal smoke will work too well in the world. Creates a new sector of the world market. German technology is. 04. school Munich is Sara Mack to fulfill a dream  the 20 year old hung up their study of Sociology on the nail and took the entrance examination for the Performing Arts Center in Munich. In Germany s first musical school for American model is trained hard   dance singing and acting. The all round education should take four years. Kathy Murphy comes from New York City. In Munich she is one of the many teachers and teachers who will pass on to German eleven musical know how from the United States. By Kathy who was already at her own studies in Germany Sara hopes to learn a lot. Kathy the American Munich praises their German pupils. What still missing especially at the jazz dance is the looseness in the movement of the whole body which in turn is a strength of American dancers. A musical without vocals. The teacher Mary Morgan comes from Detroit Michigan. What should look easy is hard for aspiring artists and exhausting. Short break before we continue with tap dancing. This is Adrienne Dostal the German teacher and founder of the performing arts center  she has long worked in New York. The long training day comes to an end with the big final appearance   before the mirror but   who knows when   soon before an enthusiastic audience. Germans and Americans work together. And Sara wants to make it. 05. Husum to the Crocus flower of the poet Theodor Storm has called his hometown Husum on the German North Sea coast the grey town by the sea. Husum is one of the most colourful cities of in Germany at the time of the Crocus flower. No one knows how the million Crocuses in the North did. There were it monks who wanted to win from the plant dye was a Duchess that saffron had hoped the Spice for their sugar bakery but it chose the wrong kind of Crocus  The monument to Theodor storms. The poet considered the greatest son of the city. Over 100 years ago he described the people and landscape of his homeland which is characterized by the eternal struggle against the sea. The monument of the Husum girl tine is the center of a city that lives with so many testimonies of past centuries but in the present. With the famous Crocuses come the tourists who want to see not only a city reminiscent of the medieval and its port. Here the North Sea reaches almost to the marketplace. Especially in the 16th century Husum was an important port town with thriving shipbuilding industry. Today the Husumer advertise with fresh air sunshine good food and unspoilt nature for their grey city by the sea. 06. soccer Stuttgart   Bremen Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.

Will Bremen lose the sure out team at Munich  A unique remote duel. After the break  The second goal for VfB Stuttgart. Again Allg wer was successful. Fans of Bremen and coach Otto Rehhagel are not only disappointed that Stuttgart so unexpectedly no plays and makes a fool of the Favorites they know from the radio broadcast that it is at the same time in the other game of the day 3 0 for Bayern. It takes until the 80th minute to Herder Bremen scored the consolation goal. But for Burgsm llers shot to aufkonmen no great praise.

Before 65000 spectators in the stadium and millions of fans on the televisions provide to Stuttgart ensure that the Munich won the German Championship. The Bremer wanted to go as a master of the place. But sports luck was against it. 07. Mozart at the residence of the place  the castle in W rzburg. Music  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Every year thousands of music lovers come here   to the Mozart fest. Synphonien and chamber music concerts in unique scenery. The staircase is a creation of architect Balthasar Neumann.

" Shaking hands ",Thailand
" Germans are great hand shakers and they like to do so both when arriving and when departing. It is common for a person who is joining a group to shake hands with every single individual. ",Thailand
" Drinking ",Thailand
" Beer and wine are part of a normal dinner and alcoholic drinks are usually offered to guests. Not drinking however is completely accepted. Do not insist on alcoholic drinks if a person has rejected your initial offer and don t order them for them. A German who rejects a drink is not just being shy or polite but does not want to drink. For some cultures it is uncommon to see teenagers order a beer at restaurants and pubs. Remember that the legal drinking age in Germany is 16 for beer and wine and 18 for spirits. ",Thailand
" Punctuality ",Thailand
" Don t turn up late for an appointment or when meeting people. Germans are extremely punctual and even a few minutes  delay can offend. Be five to 10 minutes early for important appointments and be sure to call the people you are meeting if you really cannot make it in time. ",Thailand
" Du and Sie ",Thailand
" In private the older person suggests using the informal du to the younger person. In the business world the higher ranking person regardless of age and sex would always be the one to suggest switching to du. A nice intermediate step is to address a person by their first name but then use the formal Sie. Always ask however before you decide to take this step. If you re not on a first name basis in German you can still switch when speaking English. But don t forget to switch back. ",Thailand
" Titles ",Thailand
" Titles of nobility belong to an individual s name such as F rstin von Metternich. When in doubt it is advisable to ask. Academic titles also belong to the name such as Herr Doktor M ller or Frau Professor Weise. ",Thailand
" Flowers ",Thailand
" Bring flowers if you re invited to a German home for some social occasion. If the flowers are wrapped in paper remember to take off the wrapping just before you enter the home. ",Thailand
" Garbage ",Thailand
" Germans are extremely environmentally conscious and separate their garbage to facilitate recycling. If your neighbors spot you throwing recyclable glass or paper into the regular garbage your relationship could be strained for good. ",Thailand
" Kissing ",Thailand
" When close friends greet each other it is common to kiss both the left and right cheeks. However this is considered inappropriate in a business setting. ",Thailand
" Silverware language ",Thailand
" Crossing the knife and fork on your plate is an indication that you are not yet finished with your meal. Placing knife and fork on the right side of the plate in parallel is a signal to the waiter that you have finished and that the plate can be cleared away. ",Thailand
" Knocking ",Thailand
" When entering an office it is common to knock first and then enter the room immediately. ",Thailand
" Names ",Thailand
" It is polite to address everyone by their family name and Sie. Do not leave off double barreled names such as Frau M ller Weber. Names are inserted into conversation after every few sentences. ",Thailand
" Birthdays ",Thailand
" You do not have to throw a party for yourself but if you do provide food and drinks for all your guests.  In return they ll give you presents.  It is also common to bring some cake for your colleagues on your birthday. ",Thailand
" Closed doors ",Thailand
" Germans enjoy quietness and privacy. They may thus often close their doors but will be happy to receive you if you knock on the door. A closed door doesn t necessarily mean that the person cannot be disturbed. Likewise a closed bathroom door in somebody s house does not mean the bathroom is occupied. ",Thailand
" Telephoning ",Thailand
" Don t call people at home after 10 p.m. unless you ve asked them first if it s all right. Don t expect to reach anyone in the office after 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and after 4 p.m. on Fridays. When answering the phone in Germany it is common to identify yourself with your last name. ",Thailand
" Fr ulein ",Thailand
" Forget this outdated form of addressing young women. These days rather than being seen as polite it can be offensive. Just use the normal Frau M ller. ",Thailand
" Nudity ",Thailand
" In Germany you might be confronted with a much more tolerant open attitude to public nudity than might be the case in your home country. Saunas a minority of swimming pools and even some public parks on sunny days are considered to be textile free at least at particular times. Getting together completely naked in a sauna however has no sexual dimension to it whatsoever. But if you feel you would be uncomfortable it may be a good idea to ask first before you join a trip to the pool. This attitude spills over to television where the programs and even the commercials can feature more nudity than is the case in most countries. ",Thailand
" Greetings ",Thailand
" When customers enter shops especially smaller outlets they greet everyone in the shop. The same is true of doctors  waiting rooms. So practice saying Guten Tag and Auf Wiedersehen. ",Thailand
" Seating in restaurants ",Thailand
" It is common to share tables with perfect strangers when restaurants are full and very busy. Before you do so however always point to the free seat and ask Ist dieser Platz noch frei   Is this seat free  . Also wish the other diners at the table Guten Appetit. But don t expect any further conversation at the table. It may be very welcome but you shouldn t force it. When you leave be sure to bid farewell to your table companions. ",Thailand
" Toasting ",Thailand
" It s common to clink glasses with a Prost  cheers  or Zum Wohl  good health  before drinking. At official dinners it is more common to lift the glass by the stem and nod meaningfully to the others. The host should lead the toast. At a dinner party or in a restaurant you should not start eating or drinking until everyone in the group has received their drink or their meal and then follow the lead of the host. ",Thailand

" This study is the first to analyse the manifold interrelations between armed conflicts and the human and natural environments both historically and sociologically. While most research to date has dealt with this topic primarily with regard to environmental destruction caused by acts of war or armament in peacetime this publication goes one step further by highlighting the historical changes to this complex interrelationship with concrete examples  from the Second World War in Europe and Asia via the classic proxy war in Vietnam to the current asymmetric wars in South Asia. At the same time it focuses on systematic questions  How do environments influence armed conflicts  How do wars change environments  And how do complete  war landscapes   warscapes  emerge in which war and militarisation permanently change the relations between people and their environment  ",Thailand

" Franconia  The Bavarian Tuscany ",Thailand
" Upper Franconia has the highest density of beer breweries in the world. For many people nothing beats visiting a Franconian beer garden sipping an ice cold beer underneath shady chestnut trees. If you want to cool off you can go to one of the most beautiful caverns in Bavaria or speed down the slopes on a toboggan. ",Thailand
" About the region ",Thailand
" Franconia is situated in the northern part of Bavaria but after you ve been there a while you ll discover that the region has distinct traditions and a proud history of its own. This is where you ll find Franconian Switzerland   a nature reserve with many castles and opportunities for recreation. The region is home to numerous medieval towns nestled in the idyllic landscape. Visitors can experience the cultural highlights of today and discover the traces of Franconia s historic past. ",Thailand
" Getting there ",Thailand
" Take the regional train from Nuremberg or Bayreuth to the small town of Neuhaus. Get on the bus 343 otherwise known as the Beer Lunch and Castle Express. At the weekends this bus will take you through the region and after about half an hour you ll reach the Teufelsh hle  Devil s Cave  the first stop on your tour through Franconian Switzerland. ",Thailand
" Going deep and rising high  Tour 1  ",Thailand
" The Teufelsh hle is a stalactite cavern and is icy cold   even in the summer  the temperature inside hovers around nine degrees Celsius all year round. In this subterranean world you ll discover the papal tiara an organ and an entire skeleton of a prehistoric cave bear. On a guided tour through the cavern you can learn interesting facts about how stalactites and stalagmites form. There is no need to sign up in advance for a tour  simply ask at the ticket counter when the next tour begins  tours in German admission price for students around four euros . ",Thailand
" From there you can continue on foot to the lake Sch ngrundsee. The question is   should you head toward the lake first or climb up the mountain  If you decide for the mountain then you ll have the chance to take the summer toboggan run to the right of the lake. On the Frankenrodel  summer only  and the Frankenbob slides you ll zoom down into the valley at breakneck speeds. The Frankenrodel is a 1160m long stainless steel slide with lots of curves and zigzags. But if you d rather plunge  instead of slide you can try out the bungee trampoline near the toboggan run. ",Thailand
" My opinion ",Thailand
" A friend of mine at university first told me about the breath taking landscape and things to do around Nuremberg. Although I come from Bavaria myself I wasn t familiar with the region of Franconia. In the meantime I ve become a real Franconia fan  ",Thailand
" Proceeding along the edge of the woods you continue on your way to Pottenstein. After these physical activities the restaurant Gasthaus Krone on the marketplace is a perfect spot to take a break. Here you can sit outside and enjoy the specialties of Franconia. An insider tip for sweet tooths   the Apfelk chle  apple tart  with vanilla ice cream. This classical Franconian dessert is usually served only in the evenings but when it comes to Apfelk chle the cake chef is always willing to make an exception. ",Thailand
" For the rest of the day it s back to the Middle Ages  On the other side of the marketplace there s a small street to the right that leads up a steep incline to Burg Pottenstein. It s the oldest castle in the region and the central landmark of the town. Once you ve reached the top you can visit various exhibitions inside the castle itself. ",Thailand
" At the Scharfrichtermuseum  Executioner s Museum  on the marketplace be prepared to witness the sinister and brutal deeds of the past  The museum presents one of the darkest chapters of medieval history rife with executions the undead and severed heads. Paying the four euro admission fee you ll encounter fascinating tales of torture and its instruments and the fates of former prisoners. ",Thailand
" On the next day you will take the Brewery Route. We recommend staying overnight at the youth hostel in Pottenstein but you could also take the Beer Lunch and Castle Express back to Neuhaus if you d like. The bus stop Pottenstein B470 is located in the centre of town. If you start from Neuhaus take the regional train in the direction of Nuremberg or Bayreuth. ",Thailand
" More Photos ",Thailand
" On the Brewery Route  Tour 2  ",Thailand
" On your second day in Franconia take the Beer Lunch and Castle Express again and disembark at the last stop Waischenfeld. Perched above this picturesque medieval town is Waischenfeld Castle which is also where the tour begins. In the tavern located in the castle courtyard you can try a Waischenfelder Burgbier  castle beer . Or simply enjoy the view of the city from the viewing platform. A large medieval market with vendors court jesters and knights takes place at the castle at the end of August. ",Thailand
" From here you take the same way back down over the river and left down Fischergasse which will lead you out of town. At the edge of town you ll spot the sign Brauereienweg   Brewery Route  with an arrow pointing you in the right direction. Keep your eye out for this sign for it shows you the way along the entire route. ",Thailand
" Passing through a natural tunnel of trees and shrubbery you ll soon find yourself in the village of Nankendorf. There s a brewery here too but there are more traditional ones coming up so just keep walking  In the beer garden at the Krug Br u restaurant in Breitenlesau you can experience one of the most traditional sides of Franconia. Here you ll find guests sitting under large chestnut trees drinking mugs of cold beer fresh from the tap   the Franconian way of life pure and simple  Native Franconians like to drink their beer with Scheuferla  crispy roasted shoulder of pork  with dumplings and a side dish   a culinary specialty of the region. ",Thailand
" After this extended break it s time to head back. Simply return the same way you came following the arrows pointing to Waischenfeld. A small path through the forest and other signs will lead you back to the centre of town. ",Thailand
" This is a perfect tour if you like being out in nature and don t mind walking long distances. Taking the breaks into account the tour takes about four and a half to five hours. Naturally you could also sit down on any of the benches along the way and eat your own packed lunch   but enjoying a cold beer under chestnut trees in a Franconian beer garden is an experience you shouldn t miss. Before starting your tour in Waischenfeld we recommend checking the bus timetables to find out when you have to catch the bus back. In this way you can plan your breaks better on your tour. ",Thailand
" Conclusion ",Thailand
" If you really want to experience what the region has to offer you should stay for an entire weekend. Then you can combine the two tours with an overnight stay. ",Thailand
" Important information ",Thailand
" The Beer Lunch and Castle Express  bus 343  only runs from May to November on Saturdays and Sundays. ",Thailand
" You can only take the tour along the Brewery Route  tour 2  at the weekends because it s not so easy to get to Waischenfeld with public transportation during the week. ",Thailand
" Burg Pottenstein is closed on Mondays. ",Thailand

" Throughout the history of religions their holy texts and norms have been sources of images of men in societies around the world and have presented forms of masculinity that have found expression in religious acts and rituals. This volume examines how this reciprocal influence has shifted over time by bringing together research on different religious traditions from noted experts in the field such as Bj rn Krondorfer Yvonne Maria Werner and John Powers. It analyses similarities and differences in the interwoven relationships between specific religions and between concepts and practices of masculinity in different societies and cultures such as Western forms of Christianity during the 19th and 20th centuries European Judaism and Arabic Islam during the Middle Ages and South Asian Buddhism and Hinduism. This book is the first to compare research on a variety of religions and forms of masculinity and thereby contributes to the steadily growing field of interdisciplinary research on  critical  men s studies in religion.

" Hannover for gourmets ",Thailand
" Lovers of fine food will find a spectacular variety in Hannover. Whether you prefer haute cuisine international specialities unusual themed restaurants or traditional regional delicacies there is something to suit every taste. ",Thailand
" From good plain fare to multiculti ",Thailand
" The capital of Lower Saxony is home to foods and flavours from all over the globe and offers a huge selection of specialities from the Mediterranean Asia and Latin America. Good plain German fare is served not only in many local pubs but also in top class restaurants. Foodies can look forward to creative crossover cuisine with highly imaginative culinary combinations. ",Thailand
" Nearly every district has its own Italian or Greek. Turkish cuisine is also a firm feature ranging from simple kebab shops to sophisticated eateries. The choice of Far Eastern venues covers everything from fast food to first class. The magazine Hannover geht aus   provides comprehensive information  in German  about the culinary scene in and around Hannover. ",Thailand
" Queen of the vegetables and high spirited dexterity ",Thailand
" The traditional regional cuisine tends to be solid and substantial   as you would expect of the locals who according to the regional anthem of Lower Saxony have their feet firmly on the ground and can weather any storm . Most dishes are typically served with potatoes sometimes in new fangled variations but first and foremost as good old boiled potatoes. In spring asparagus is very popular  this finest of all veg tastes equally good with melted butter or hollandaise sauce and is normally accompanied with cured ham a pork or veal escalope or salmon. When autumn comes around it is the start of the curly kale season which is traditionally enjoyed with a regional spicy sausage speciality. ",Thailand
" Regional delicacies also include a platter of cold cuts and wedding day soup  a popular starter which contains tiny meat dumplings and egg garnish. Yeast cake topped with butter and almonds is traditionally served with afternoon coffee while Welfenspeise  a typical local desert consisting of blancmange and zabaglione takes its royal name in reminiscence of Hannover s role as the capital of the Kingdom of Guelph in the 19th century. ",Thailand
" L ttje Lage  a drink that is exclusive to Hannover originates from the annual Marksmen s Fair. The ritual has a strong alcoholic focus and requires two special glasses  one filled with L ttje Lage beer the other with clear schnapps. The trick is to hold the beer glass between thumb and index finger of one hand and the schnapps glass between the middle and ring fingers of the same hand and then raise both glasses to your lips so that the schnapps and beer can be drunk in one go. The L ttje Lage tradition dates back to the days of beer brewer Cord Broyhan in the 16th century. The Broyhan Haus   where the brewery pioneer lived   is now a gastropub in the city s second oldest half timbered building. ",Thailand
" Visitors who are interested in the history and technical aspects of brewing are advised to book a tour of Herrenh user brewery. In addition to the major traditional breweries Gilde and Herrenh user Hannover also has a large number of microbreweries which serve their customers first class home brew such as Brauhaus Ernst August on the edge of the Old Town. ",Thailand
" Excellent and unexpected ",Thailand
" Hannover s only Michelin star restaurant is situated in the only street in the region which is under a preservation order  Ole Deele in Heinrich W hler Strasse in Grossburgwedel which has defended its star for four years. Other top class restaurants in and around Hannover which have earned a mention in the major restaurant guides include Titus Die Insel Le Monde and Tropeano Di Vino in Hannover Gasthaus Lege in Burgwedel Berggasthaus Niedersachsen in Gehrden and Gasthaus M ller in Barsinghausen. ",Thailand
" However discerning gourmets also appreciate creative culinary experiences outside the ranks of haute cuisine   especially when served in an original setting. For instance who would expect to find top of the range and outstandingly fresh cuisine at Theater am K chengarten  tak  which is actually a cult cabaret venue  Or that eat the world  offers culinary guided trips around the city  Hannover is also home to the World Of Kitchen  WOK  the only museum in Europe that is dedicated to this subject. Not to forget summer events such as Maschsee Lake Festival outdoor venues including a large number of beautiful beer gardens and rooftop terraces such as Sch ne Aussichten 360  Roof Garden or 6 Sinne Skybar Restaurant. Another tip for culinary aficionados is the solar powered catamaran which cruises back and forth on Maschsee Lake from April to November and serves a fantastic Sunday brunch. ",Thailand
" Souvenirs from the countryside ",Thailand
" A trip to Lake Steinhude need not end when you return home as there are all kinds of regional treats you can take back with you for example from the traditional eel smokeries. Some Steinhude smokehouses also offer guided tours   which are best accompanied by a drop of the hard stuff such as the clear schnapps distilled at Warnecke s in Bredenbeck am Deister. What s more a meal at one of the many countryside inns is the perfect way to relax after a hike on the tree clad slopes of the Deister Hills. Another recommended souvenir from the region comes from Dupr s   Co. in Neustadt am R benberge the only makers of sparkling wine in Lower Saxony. ",Thailand

" Neben den regul ren Neuver ffentlichungen gibt es alle Jahre wieder seit 2007 die Booster Serie die sich laut Tangerine Dreams Eastgate Musicshop zu  one of the best accepted CD releases out of our very extensive catalogue gemausert hat. Warum das so ist wei  ich nicht. Denn eigentlich bieten die Booster Alben die stets als Doppel CD und Download erscheinen meist wenig Neues. So auch im Falle der f nften Booster Ausgabe. Neben 14 unver nderten Songs aus Alben der Jahre 2010 und 2011  Zeitgeist The Endless Season The Island of the Fay The Angel of the West Window Finnegan s Wake und Mona da Vinci  gibt es zwei kurze Remixe  Calymba Caly und View from a distant Star . Mit Shining Ray Twilight Dance Sailing through the Night und Booster Battery liegen auch immerhin vier Neukompositionen aus der Feder von Edgar Froese bzw. Thomas Quaeschning vor. Im 4 seitigen informationsarmen Booklet ist Tangerine Dream in der sechsk pfigen Besetzung von The Island of the Fay abgebildet. Konkrete Angaben zu den jeweiligen St cken fehlen jedoch. Da w ren mehr Infos schon w nschenswert. ",Thailand
" In der Summe ergibt sich ein musikalisch vollkommen konsistentes Album das bei all seiner Vielfalt der vermittelten Stimmungen von einer eher ruhigen oftmals mystischen Atmosph re des sph rischen Flusses im modernen elektronischen rhythmischen Puls gepr gt ist. Wem ein beliebiges Tangerine Dream Album der letzten Jahre gefallen hat  Ausnahme  Under Cover  der wird auch an dieser geschmackvoll zusammen gestellten Kollektion Gefallen finden. Diesem Eindruck dienlich sein d rfte auch der  berschaubare Zeitraum der Auswahl. Es befinden sich zwar auch St cke dabei die in ihren Grundlagen auf Alben der 70er Jahre zur ckgehen  Rubycon 2010 Resurrection of the Spirit  die aber soundm  ig bereits auf den ausgew hlten Alben so zeitgem    berarbeitet worden sind dass sie vollst ndig in den aktuellen Soundkosmos von Tangerine Dream passen. Die wenigen St cke die extra f r diese Zusammenstellung eingespielt worden sind fallen nat rlich auch keineswegs aus dem Rahmen. ",Thailand
" Warum nun aber gerade die Booster Serie zu  one of the best accepted CD releases out of our very extensive catalogue geraten ist erschlie t sich mir ehrlich gesagt nicht. Vielleicht lieben es die Tangerine Dream H rer einfach ihnen bekannte Songs in neuer Reihenfolge zu h ren  Vielleicht wird auch bei der geradezu un berschaubaren Ver ffentlichungsflut die Booster Serie als eine Art Best of eines  berschaubaren Zeitraums wahrgenommen  Wer einen Eindruck des aktuellen Schaffens von Tangerine Dream gewinnen will ist daher mit einem Album der Booster Serie auch nicht schlecht bedient.

" Die Beitr ge von Mostly Autumn IZZ Nektar Kansas Little Atlas und Pendragon finden sich auf regul ren Alben der jeweiligen Bands wieder. Aber da man die vielleicht nicht alle hat ist so ein Einblick m glicherweise auch mal ganz interessant. Camel sind mit einem typischen ruhigen elegischen Track am Start der bisher wohl nur auf der Japan Version von A Nod And A Wink zu finden war. Spock s Beard bieten einen der schw chsten Songs den ich jemals von dieser Band geh rt habe im Livegewand dar. Die Beitr ge von der Muffins und den Flower Kings finden sich auf regul ren Alben der Bands sind aber hier mit leichten Ver nderungen  altenate mix  vertreten. ",Thailand

FM auch schon ein  lteres Semester zeigen mit einem Live St ck von 1979 wie man Melodic Rock mit ein bisschen Violinenbeigabe interessant darbieten kann. ",Thailand
" Neben Echolyn ist auch der Beitrag von Mike Keneally ein Must Have. Keneally coverte 1996 mit seinen Beer for Dolphins  Bryan Beller Toss Panoz  ausgerechnet Genesis Time Table. Wobei er zun chst die mittelalterliche Atmosph re der Originals aufnimmt dann in Hard Rock transformiert und schliesslich in die Apocalypse in 9 8 Passage explodiert. Cool  ",Thailand
" Der Beitrag von IQ ist eher ein Solost ck von Mike Holmes aber an der Elektronik.

" Als ich mir den Plot der Geschichte die Starfighter Aff re mit dem seeligen Franz Joseph Strauss als damaligen deutschen Verteidigungsminister ansah dachte ich spontan das w re doch die ideale Geschichte f r Amon D  l II gewesen. Aber auch Calvert schafft es mit Unterst tzung seiner damaligen Bandkollegen und anderen eine recht am sante Aufnahme daraus zu machen. Kern der Aff re war ja dass Lockheed auf Wunsch der Deutschen das Flugzeug so modifizierte dass es des  fteren zum Absturz mit leider sehr vielen Toten kam. Auf der CD wird der Wunsch nach Modifikation in einem sehr sarkastischen Dialog zwischen Lockheedvertretern und F.J.S. dargestellt.  berhaupt sind des  fteren kurze Dialoge zwischen den Songs eingestreut die den Fortgang der Geschichte aufzeigen.

" Musikalisch gibt es soliden Hardrock mit Spacerockankl ngen. The Song Of The Gremlin erinnert nat rlich in der  berdrehtheit an Arthur Brown Sachen der hier die Leadstimme  bernimmt.

" Insgesamt finde ich die Scheibe recht am sant wenn man Spa  an grundsoliden Hardrockplatten mit Spacerockeinfl ssen hat und witzig umgesetzte Konzeptalben mag. Unter Proggesichtspunkten ist die CD aber eher vernachl ssigbar. ",Thailand

" Location of the castle ",Thailand
" The contours of the neo gothic building rise more than about 330 ft above the river Moselle on an outstanding hill. The silhouette of the towering hill seems to continue in the building which is topped by the slate roof of the massive keep. As for its structure Cochem Castle belongs to the category of castles protected by height that had to be protected all around. Romanesque fragments found in the well indicate a reinforcement of the castle around 1056. ",Thailand
" Around this time or a bit earlier the core of the Romanesque square keep  17ft by 17ft  was built its walls being up to 12ft thick. At the same time the keep was also made higher. In the first half of the 14th century archbishop Balduin of Trier connected the castle and the town by massive walls. Furthermore a chain was installed below the castle to form a removable toll barrier across the river. ",Thailand
" History of Cochem Castle ",Thailand
" It is generally assumed that Cochem Castle was built around the year 1000 by the palatinate count Ezzo son and successor to palatinate count Hermann Pusilius. The castle was first mentioned in a document in 1051 when Richeza Ezzo s oldest daughter and former Queen of Poland gave the castle to her nephew palatine count Henry I. Even when Ezzo s family ceased to be palatinate counts Cochem remained connected to the title of the palatinate counts. Years later in 1151 king Konrad III put an end to a dispute concerning the succession by occupying the castle with troupes. Like this he finally took control of the castle which became an imperial fiefdom. Thus Cochem became an imperial castle in the time when the Staufer dynasty reigned in Germany. From this time on imperial ministers   with the title of Lord of the castle    were installed to administer the castle and the surrounding properties. ",Thailand
" In 1294 king Adolf of Nassau pawned the castle and the city of Cochem as well as the surrounding imperial property of about 50 villages to Boemund I of Trier in order to pay for his coronation as German emperor. But neither Adolf nor his successor King Albrecht I of Austria could redeem the pledge. For this reason the archbishops of Trier kept Cochem as a hereditary fiefdom until 1794. Under the reign of Archbishop Balduin  1307 1354  the old castle was enlarged and fortified. From 1419 the Lords of the castle were replaced by local magistrates. ",Thailand
" When the troupes of King Louis XIV  called Sun King  invaded the Rhine and the Moselle area in the war of succession of the Palatinate Cochem castle too was occupied in 1688. After the town had been completely occupied by French troupes in March 1689 the castle was set on fire undermined and blown up on May 19th of 1689. ",Thailand
" The French Sun King s troops almost completely destroyed the town of Cochem. The castle remained in ruins until 1868 when a Berlin business  man Mr. Louis Raven  bought the castle grounds and the ruins. Shortly after his purchase he began to rebuild Cochem Castle incorporating the remains of the late Gothic buildings into the main castle structure. ",Thailand
" The entire structure was rebuilt in the then popular Neo Gothic architectural style. This style corresponded to the romantic ideals in vogue in Germany in the 19th century. The trend at the time throughout Germany was for nobility or other wealthy persons to purchase and refurbish castle ruins as family summer residences. The Raven  family followed this trend and used the castle as a family summer residence. ",Thailand
" Today the castle is still well equipped with Renaissance and Baroque furniture which was carefully collected by the Raven  family. Since 1978 the castle has been owned by the town of Cochem and is run by Reichsburg Cochem Ltd.  Cochem Castle situated on an outstanding hill more than 100 metres above the river Moselle is a popular tourist attraction. ",Thailand
" Louis Raven  ",Thailand
" The Huguenot family originally came from Metz and came to Berlin in 1685 as religious refugees. The family ran a brass and bell foundry. The Raven  Company had its origins in the iron trading company Samuel Gottlieb Butzer which was founded in 1722. Jakob R. married the daughter of the iron trader on 14.08.1775. After the death of his father in law in the same year he took over the business. ",Thailand
" In 1824 Jakob R. signed the business over to both his sons and his son in law. His son Pierre took on the running of the business on his own in 1833 and under his management the renowned business became a wholesale company. His son the erector of the castle Jacob Louis Fred ric R. had a large active share in the rise of the company under his father s management he then took over the control of the company and enlarged it. He married Therese Elisabeth Emelie von Kusserow in 1864 who bore him three children before falling in love with a house guest called Gustav Simon. ",Thailand
" She was separated from her husband in 1874. Although he wanted to save their marriage he did not succeed. He died in the Czech spa resort in 1879. ",Thailand
" Not so many years after Raven  s death Theodor Fontane read in the newspaper about the auction sale of Mr Raven  s plant collection and wrote a novel called L Adultera . He based the novel s character van der Straaten on Mr. Raven . In 1854 Raven  received the 4th class red eagle medal. The title of councillor of commerce was bestowed on him in 1862. He was an honorary citizen of the towns Ilmenau in Th ringen and Cochem. An imported palm from the Comoro Island Johanna was named after him in 1879 as palm Ravenea Hildebrandti. His son Dr. Louis Ferdinand Auguste Raven  was 12 years old when his father died. He took on the family business in 1887 and in 1888 he married Martha Helene Wilhelmine Ende in Berlin who was the daughter of the family architect Hermann Ende. After his wife died he got married for a second time to Elisabeth C cile von Alten. He died in 1944 in Potsdam. His grave is to be found alongside that of his first wife s in Marquardt a district of Potsdam. ",Thailand
" The reconstruction ",Thailand
" In the course of the planning the construction of a railway line between Koblenz and Metz along the Moselle our region attracted the interest of Raven  and he fell in love with the ruin of Cochem castle. ",Thailand
" Together with the government building officer Hermann Ende Raven  put in an application already at the beginning of 1867 to the Prussian area administration in order to buy the ruin and rebuild it. About one year later in 1868 the then Prussian King Wilhelm I authorized the sale on the following conditions  ",Thailand
" The preservation of the standing ruins and the reconstruction according to historic parameters  copperplate brown and Hogenberg  ",Thailand
" Authorization of the building plans by the Minister for science and culture ",Thailand
" Partial opening of the castle for the public ",Thailand
" Pre emption right of the state ",Thailand
" The sum of 300 Talers was a symbolic price they orientated themselves on a similar case   the sale of the ruin Hammerstein. ",Thailand
" In June 1868 under the direction of Professor and royal building officer Ende they started to clear away the huge piles of debris and uncovered and secured all the foundation walls and the foundations as well as cellars on the Moselle side of the castle and the castle well. The castle was rebuilt on top and the highest rooms were furnished for the constructor. ",Thailand
" As from 1871 the second part of the reconstruction was started under the direction of building officer Julius Carl Raschdorff. Building officer Raschdorff was known for renaissance buildings  the Wallraf Richartz museum in Cologne  he had previously been town master builder in Cologne and had already acquired an excellent reputation. ",Thailand
" The planning of the exterior was kept in accordance with the conditions of sale. The sketched plans from the architectural drawing book are still available today. The planning of the interior was also left to Raschdorff however these sketches were not passed on down to us today. The interior design was assigned to Prof. Ernst Ewald from Berlin. He designed the intricate painted decoration on the ceilings and the walls on the inside and the outside. The poker work he carried out either himself or had his employees G the and the painter M nster from Cologne do it for him. But local artists and craftsmen also played a part. The rooms are accordingly decorative and the furniture is appropriately comfortable. The old styles of building were taken into consideration which had been used in its one thousand year old history. ",Thailand
" SConsequently our guests today during the guided tour will come across amongst other things a dining room in Neo renaissance style a gothic and a Romanesque room. In 1877 the inauguration of the castle and the opening of the Emperor Wilhelm railway tunnel were celebrated with a banquet in the knight s hall in the castle. High ranking guests were present. The seat next to Mr Raven  however remained empty as his wife had left him. ",Thailand
" Legends around the castle ",Thailand
" The battle of the barrels ",Thailand
" We are in Cochem castle. The year of its construction dates back to 1000 AD. The castle was a medieval structure of defence like other knights  castles but maybe a little nobler as it housed the counts of the Palatinate along the Rhine who were related to the German Emperors at the time when they were all called Emperor Otto. The history of the castle ranked itself seamlessly in the social fabric of its time with its intrigues and battles of power. Favourable marriages increased the powers of the powerful. But also murder and manslaughter were common in order to assassinate disagreeable fellow men and rivals. And so it came to pass that in 1062 Countess Mathilde of the Palatinate had the death of her husband on her conscience or for instance Count Hermann of Salm and Luxembourg former German King accidentally stoned to death the vigilant damsel of the castle in 1086. The counts of the Rhineland Palatinate   their territories wedged between the archdioceses of Cologne Trier and Mainz   left the Moselle region and took up residence from then on in Heidelberg. The Prince of the Electorate and Archbishop of Trier used this opportunity to unite the Archdiocese Trier with Koblenz. Cochem Castle became an administration centre the Moselle region was on the whole spared of various wars and the people of the Moselle were fond of saying life is good under the rule of the hooked staff . It was however never entirely peaceful in the German states. The Knight Franz of Sickingen and his troupes drew in on Trier. The Prince of the Electorate called on the people of his electorate for help. From Cochem and Zell 386 armed men marched hurriedly to Trier. You have to credit them for their bravery because Knight Franz gave up the siege and withdrew. However his troupes enraged by the lost chance of a victory took out their anger on the Moselle villages. One of these mobs approached Cochem. When they saw the town s gates were barricaded they camped out on the meadow by the Endert stream and prepared themselves to storm the town. The councillors of Cochem who had to organise the defence of the town were in dire straits. Then one of them had an idea. They ordered everyone to roll the empty wine barrels up to the Endert town gateway and to pile them up high. As the ramshackle mob began to storm the town the next morning they pushed over the pyramid of barrels. The barrels rumbled and tumbled down the hill straight into the ranks of the attackers. They were oppressed and crushed and withdrew. They thought of course in a town with so many empty wine barrels there could hardly be any full wine barrels left to loot  The people of Cochem still tell the tale today over a round of drinks about their cunning ruse back then and the victory of the battle of the barrels  ",Thailand
" Knipp Monday ",Thailand
" There is supposed to have been more than 40.000 Knights  castles at one time in the German speaking part of Europe. They were the fortified bases of powerful people. They reported back on movements of troupes in their areas and were supposed to be able to fight small conflicts until the local lords summoned together enough troupes for a battle. Such a surprise attack on Cochem castle was uncovered by a castle servant who was riding along on high ground up in the village of Faid on white Sunday   the 1st Sunday after Easter  on his way to visiting his sweetheart. He encountered armed strangers and heard about their planned attack on Cochem castle. The servant galloped away immediately back to the castle and raised alarm. The men at the castle armed themselves ready for defence. The next morning when the mob attacked the castle they ended up beating a speedy retreat with bloody heads. The lord of the castle was very grateful to his men for their vigilance and bravery he gave them the day off work and declared the Monday after white Sunday to be a public holiday for the people of the castle and the town for evermore. Since then the people of Cochem make their way with baskets full of food and jugs full of wine to a meadow by the name of Knipp  just above the castle where the attackers had prepared their assault that time. They eat drink sing and make merry and the young people make up for what the servant and his sweetheart had to go without on that day back then  They celebrate every year since then Knipp Monday .

" Travelling in the Altmark ",Thailand
" The Altmark is a rural region facing similar challenges to other areas in the countryside. A good quality of life is guaranteed in many areas and work is under way on comprehensive medical care and broadband Internet. ",Thailand
" Life in the country sounds romantic. We have this ideal image from children s books with a small house lots of animals green nature and tranquillity. But in reality many people move away from the countryside to the cities. Nature and tranquillity also mean that we have to accept a few kilometres  drive to the bank cinema or doctor. Like many rural regions in Germany the Altmark is struggling to attract young doctors and wants to make work more attractive for doctors and nurses. There are elderly people who need good medical care especially in the countryside. The expansion of broadband should also enable additional services such as remote diagnosis. ",Thailand
" The supply of fresh food is very good in the Altmark you will even find shopping facilities in small villages. Since many foods are grown and harvested locally farmers like to take advantage of the opportunity for personal direct marketing. Visit the popular farm shops farmers  markets and milk filling stations. People from the city even drive to these to get fresh regional food. ",Thailand

" Tiruva   malai T luk.  North western t luk of South Arcot District Madras lying between 11  58  and 12  35  N. and 78  38  and 79  17  E. In the west a spur of the Jav di Hills of North Arcot locally known as the Tenmalais   south hills   runs down into it   and in the south it includes the corner of the Kalr yan Hills round about Chekkadi which is sometimes called the Chekkadi hills. Both these ranges are malarious. They are inhabited by Malaiy lis a body of Tamils who at some remote period settled upon them and now differ considerably from their fellows in the plains in their ways and customs. On them are large blocks of  reserved  forest in which grow sandal wood teak and a few other timber trees forming the most important of the Reserves in the District. Tiruva   malai is  S. 401  the largest t luk in South Arcot its area being 1009 square miles and its population which numbered 244085 in 1901 compared with 205403 in 1891 increased during that decade by 18.8 per cent. showing a higher rate of growth than any other. It is still however the most sparsely peopled in the District the density being only 242 persons per square mile compared with the District average of 450. It contains 400 villages and one town the municipality of Tiruva   malai  population 17069  the head quarters. The rainfall is the lightest in South Arcot being 36 inches annually compared with the District average of 43 inches   and the t luk is more liable to scarcity than its neighbours. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903 4 amounted to Rs. 432000. ",Thailand
" Tiruva   malai Town. Head quarters of the t luk of the same name in South Arcot District Madras situated in 12  14  N. and 79  4  E. with a station on the Villupuram Dharmavaram branch of the South Indian Railway. The population in 1901 was 17069 of whom 14981 were Hindus 1932 Musalmans and the rest Christians. Roads diverge in four directions and it is an entrepot of trade between South Arcot and the country to the west. The name means  holy fire hill  and is derived from the isolated peak at the back of the town 2668 feet above the sea which is a conspicuous object for many miles around. The story runs that  iva and P rvat  his wife were walking one evening in the flower garden of Kail  a when P rvat  playfully put her hands over  iva s eyes. Instantly the whole world became darkened and the sun and moon ceased to give light   and though to  iva and his wife it seemed only a moment yet to the unfortunate dwellers in the world the period of darkness lasted for years. They petitioned  iva for relief and to punish P rvat  for her thoughtlessness he ordered her to do penance at various holy places. Tiruva   malai was one of these and when she had performed her penance here  iva appeared as a flame of fire at the top of the hill as a sign that she was forgiven. A large and beautifully sculptured temple stands at the foot of the hill and at a festival in the month of K rtigai  November December  the priests light a huge beacon at the top of the hill in memory of the story. This festival is one of the chief cattle fairs in the District. The hill and the temple commanding the Chengam pass into Salem played an important part in the Wars of the Carnatic. Between. 1753 and 1790 they were subject to repeated attacks and captures. From 1760 the place was a British post and Colonel Smith fell back upon it in 1767 as he retired through the Chengam pass before Haidar Al  and the Niz m. Here he held out till reinforced when he signally defeated the allies. In 1790 after being repulsed from Ty ga Durgam Tip  attacked the town and captured it. Tiruva   malai was constituted a municipality in 1896.  S. 402  The receipts and expenditure up to 1902 3 averaged Rs. 18800 and Rs. 18500 respectively. In 1903 4 the income most of which was derived from tolls and the house and land taxes was Rs. 20800   and the expenditure was Rs. 19100. The municipal area covers 11 square miles. One of the chief reasons for bringing it under sanitary control was that cholera used frequently to break out at the annual festival and be carried by the fleeing pilgrims far and wide through the District. The great want of the place is a proper water supply and experiments are in course of initiation. ",Thailand

" A  aiva sacred complex of South India ",Thailand
" This is a collective programme of the Ecole Fran aise d Extr me Orient  Pondicherry  in which have been involved an Indian epigraphist  French Institute of Pondicherry  three members of the E.F.E.O.  covering geography archaeology architecture iconography and related studies  an E.H.E.S.S. researcher  in ethnology  and a doctoral student in demography holding a scholarship for a period of study in India. In addition there was assistance from Indian associates  in Pondicherry  primarily in epigraphy  rubbings card indexing etc.  ",Thailand
" The project ",Thailand
" These studies of Tiruva   malai originated with an historical enquiry   the antiquity of this sacred complex is attested by an epigraphical corpus which showed itself to be more significant than previously supposed when the epigraphist found that only a part of the inscriptions on the temple walls were recorded by the Epigraphy Department. ",Thailand
" To undertake an overall survey of the temple and its surrounding area was the logical consequence of this first discovery. And since the object of this study was a sacred complex within a fully active town a temple that had been constantly renovated over several centuries it could not be limited to archaeology in the usual sense of the term. Other perspectives had to be considered which would take into account not only the past but also a more sociological dimension as well as modern developments. ",Thailand
" Field work ",Thailand
" The rubbings begun in 1980 but completed only in 1984 included rediscovered inscriptions from various places within the temple the town and the surrounding villages as well as several recently discovered copperplates. Archaeological and iconographical analyses and other investigations started gradually in 1981 and were carried out mainly between 1982 and 1984   several other complementary studies were undertaken in 1986. None of the participants were able to devote themselves to this research full time over an extended period. Furthermore the nature of certain of the studies  observation of festivals the search for and collection of documents and of information that was difficult to obtain  required that the research be extended over a longer period of time. Each participant although having his own field of research contributed assistance and information to the work of each of the others. ",Thailand

" The temple at the place which has been celebrated for its holiness through the centuries was patronised by the rulers of almost all the royal families of Tami n  u including the Hoysa as and the Vijayanagara kings. During their rule the kings themselves had made a variety of donations to the temple. Besides some private individuals too had contributed their mite for its upkeep and maintenance. Such transactions had invariably been put into writing and engraved on the various parts of the temple. In the course of the centuries the temple received additions alternations and modifications. During these times some inscribed slabs were broken of which some fragments were reused in the new constructions but some others were probably lost. Between A.D. 1806 and 18184 when Col. Colin Mackenzie was engaged in copying the inscriptions in the temples of the Madras Presidency he had arranged for copying the epigraphs in the temple in question. Curiously of about 500 items of epigraphs found here his assistants had copied only ten  South Indian Temple Ins. I Nos. 105 114 pp. 114 24 . Of these S.I.T.I. Nos. 105 107 109 110 111 have been subsequently copied and the rest are not traceable. Besides one line notices of nineteen items prepared by two assistants are also found in the Mackenzie Mss.  D. 2869 and 2760 of S.I.T.I. pp. 124 25 . The Office of the Government Epigraphist visited the place in 1902 and copied 106 epigraphs which were reported in that year s Annual Report as Nos. B 469 574. Subsequently their texts alone were published in South Indian Inscriptions Vol. VIII  Madras 1937  as Nos. 57 to 165 totalling to 109 because of the fact that A.R.E.  Annual Report on Epigraphy  Nos. 476 488 and 539 were each split into two. That office visited the place again 1928 29 and copied ten more inscriptions which are reported as A.R.E. 1928 29 Nos. B 419 28. In 1945 46 they visited the place once more and copied sixteen new inscriptions and reported them in the A.R.I.E.  Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy  1945 46 as Nos. B 66 81. Lastly they paid a visit to the place in 1952 53. In this trip they copied only two stone Inscriptions  A.R.I.E. Nos. B 212 13 of 1952 53  and four copper plate epigraphs  ibid. A 8 11  which were In the custody of the Executive Officer of the temple there. The epigraphy office had been able to bring 134 inscriptions and four copper plate records from 1902 to 1952 53 of this place to the notice of the scholars. In our comprehensive and sustained survey of the temple for inscriptions conducted intermittently from 1979 to 1984 we have been able to copy about 360 new inscriptions many of them in their full form containing important pieces of information and the rest fragmentary. Besides four new copper plate inscriptions have also been copied in this survey. A list of all the inscriptions arranged in a chronological order is appended at the end. They range in date from the last decade of the 9th century to about A.D. 1800. ",Thailand

" Chapter 1 ",Thailand
" Tiruva   malai in its regional context ",Thailand
" If we try to find out what fundamental urge might have made people settle at Tiruva   malai in large numbers we note that it was not the poor soils of the gneissic pediplain on which it is situated that have fostered the development of the town although through refashioning by the hand of man the water supply available has proved sufficient. ",Thailand
" The urban community seems to have grown around a spot where the divine presence was felt at some date unknown to us but probably much before it has been extolled by  ivaite saints in the 7th century of our era. The shrine dominated by the sacred mountain has thus generated the town and the landscape bears the marks of this specific factor. ",Thailand
" Yet if the settlement has not remained a uniquely religious one it is because locally it also occupies a position that is favourable to continuous urban development. Situated at the margin of hill and plain it is a contact town at the junction of two important arterial roads. Thus Tiruva   malai played a crucial role in military operations from at least the 15th century onwards up to the end of the Mysore wars. Under the pax britannica the town was to loose this strategic function and to confine itself to its religious role and its activities as a market centre. ",Thailand
" Chapter 2 ",Thailand
" The Mountain ",Thailand
" Fran oise L Hernault ",Thailand
" Tiruva   malai is above all its mountain which symbolises the pillar of fire from which  iva emerged. This myth has given rise to two iconographic representations. One of them is well known  the li godbhavam rti    iva appearing within the pillar of fire flanked by Brahm  and Vi  u in the attitude of worshippers. The other is a later development specific to Tiruva   malai where  iva and P rvat  are figured on a stele covered with semi circular incisions to represent the mountain  the rear face of this stele is a li ga which is visible from the rear niche of the sanctuary. This representation is known locally as a i mu i the high and the low. after the same words in poems by Sambandar and Sundarar. referring to the directions in which Brahm  and Vi  u sought the extremities of the pillar of fire. ",Thailand
" The mountain itself a cone standing alone in the midst of the plain appears on the boundary slabs of lands dedicated to the Deity of Tiruva   malai in the form of a triangle covered with semi circular incisions set either above the dynastic emblem of ga  abh ru  a the two headed bird or above the vase of plenty. ",Thailand
" The mountain symbolically defines different spaces. It is the wild uncultivated place  Tamil  k  u         as opposed to the cultivated area. This contrast is marked in the festival of Tiruv  al when  iva has his jewels stolen on the mountain in the West and finds them again in the East in landowners  villages on the edge of the town in the locality where according to legend the palace of King Ballala used to stand. ",Thailand
" At first the opposition between the top and the bottom of the mountain seems to be absent since there is not as at certain sites a temple at the bottom for the deity with his consort and a temple at the top for the deity in his yogic aspect. At Tiruva   malai the single temple  at the bottom  is identified with the mountain for which it is the substitute. The opposition is nevertheless marked four times a year by purification ceremonies  pr ya citta  for which the priests go up to the summit of the mountain. ",Thailand
" First at the time of the  ivar tri festival the appearance of the pillar of fire manifests the supremacy of  iva. A few months later comes the marriage ceremony the Union of  iva with the Goddess. A few months later again at the festival of K rttigai commemorating the appearance of the pillar of fire there is still union with the Goddess as is shown by the procession of the hermaphrodite  iva Ardhan r  vara. After K rttigai the fourth and last purification ceremony represents separation from the Goddess and the renewed manifestation of the supremacy of  iva the great Yogi. ",Thailand
" Finally as a symbol of the centre the mountain like all mystic centres emanates a space which is cardinalised in the same way as a ma  ala. The route of 14 kms around the mountain and centred on its vertical axis is oriented to the cardinal points by the distribution of shrines consecrated to the li gas of the directions. ",Thailand
" A few Pandya milestones which remain along the route inscribed with the division to which they belong have made it possible to reconstruct the division of this circuit into nine stages each corresponding to one unit of time distance the n  i  24 minutes  equivalent to 1.4 1.6 kilometres. Besides the shrines of the cardinal points the pilgrimage route is punctuated by small shrines founded by devoted individuals or groups hermitages about sixty sacred ponds wayside resting places for the deity during his two annual processions by Nandis and by footprints  p da  of  iva.

" Fran oise L Hernault and Pierre Pichard ",Thailand
" After some ten centuries of construction and enlargement the temple today forms a large rectangle. 465 m long and 225 m wide. Its longitudinal axis deviates from the East West line by 13 degrees. If we assume that this deviation was intended to align with the rising sun on the day of its foundation this would have been on either the 16th of February or the 24th of October. ",Thailand
" As usual in this book the successive enclosure walls have been identified and numbered from centre to periphery. But according to local tradition  ",Thailand
" the present day  iva shrine marks the centre of a former courtyard covered at a later date and surrounded by an enclosure wall which would logically be the first one but which is known locally as the second. ",Thailand
" what the temple priests and officers today call the first pr k ra is the low platform of late construction around the central shrine. Properly speaking there is thus no first enclosure wall  but this numbering system may refer to a former first enclosure. It is also confirmed by a 13th century inscription which mentions a building in the third pr k ra   this inscription  214 230  is now located in the courtyard of the third enclosure. ",Thailand
" following this system the present outer enclosure wall is the fifth one which would tally with the tradition that there should be an uneven number of enclosures. Ideally this number should total seven which would be achieved by counting the rectangle of the car streets as the sixth and the pilgrimage circuit  around the hill  as the seventh. ",Thailand
" According to this system all the elements of the temple have been given a reference number which appears on plate 3. They are described in order first architecturally then iconographically. ",Thailand
" Chapter 4 ",Thailand
" The Aru  cale vara Temple  building chronology ",Thailand
" Fran oise L Hernault and Pierre Pichard ",Thailand
" The central shrine is obviously the most ancient part of the temple. This is confirmed by the inscriptions on and around its base which are the oldest in the temple  end of 9th and beginning of 10th centuries ad . These are however fragmentary ones some on the shrine itself some on the platform later built around it and some even placed upside down. This clearly shows that the shrine is of ancient foundation but has been completely reconstructed and altered  this is confirmed by the stylistic study of its architecture. The square hall adjacent to its eastern side can be dated to the 16th century and most probably the renovation of the shrine was carried out at the same period. The present second enclosure wall was built in two parts  the most ancient is the western portion where there are numerous inscriptions from 1030 1040 ad. This portion may represent three sides of a first enclosure  fig. 39  built soon after the completion of the central shrine. A second partial enclosure wall was then added on its eastern side  fig. 40  certainly before the end of the 12th century when the third enclosure was built. In its courtyard several structures were added during the 12th and 13th centuries  fig. 41  including a shrine for the goddess at the site of the present one which was first rebuilt during the 16th century and then again at the end of the 19th. With the fourth enclosure begins the plan with four gateways one on each side. The north and south ones however with their unusually small size and location on the eastern part of the walls  fig. 42  can only be explained by reference to the fifth enclosure which doubled the area of the temple at one stroke by a large eastward extension. These two enclosures must thus have been designed together as one project under the reign of Ballala III  1291 1342 AD  who attached his name to the eastern gateway of the fourth enclosure  but the fifth enclosure could not be completed before the 16th century. ",Thailand
" This was a very active period for the temple  fig. 43 . with this huge fifth enclosure and its great gateways being completed by 1570 and construction of the 1000 pillared hall and the pond in front of it as well as the complete transformation and reconstruction of the central shrine and first enclosure which was again to be greatly altered under the Nattukkottai Chettyars at the beginning of our century. ",Thailand
" This long history has brought about a drastic reversal in the image of the temple from a structure where the central shrine is the dominant element  cf. Tanjavur              towards a more complex design dominated by the gateways which are larger and higher as one progresses outwards. This reversal is not due to technical factors as to build a high tower above four gates involves more work than building a single one above the sanctum. ",Thailand
" The new model is more elaborate. From the temple as centre of the world the divine energy pervades the space around it in the four cardinal directions its growing intensity expressed by the systematically increasing height of each successive gateway   contrary to human perceptions and actions which decrease with distance  sight voice power. . . . ",Thailand
" Architecturally stressing the gateways instead of the sanctum implies that the approach may be more important than the arrival. It may be relevant to link this architectural reversal to the bhakti movement and its emphasis on personal devotion  the progress the approach to the god is then reflected in the entranceways to the temple by gates and doors which are progressively reduced until the dark central inner sanctum is attained.

" The town s archaeological remains ",Thailand
" Fran oise L Hernault ",Thailand
" The town which today with its 100000 inhabitants possesses about 150 temples had at the end of the 19th century only 10000 inhabitants and therefore proportionately far fewer religious buildings. These were essentially shrines consecrated to  iva for we know that the temples to Ga apati Subrahma ya and the Goddess are a recent phenomenon. ",Thailand
" Although there was a K l  protectress of the locality facing North it seems that a Durg  temple connected with a local myth was particularly developed and that its deity came to be considered the protectress of the town as is shown by the ceremonies at the start of the K rttigai festival. ",Thailand
" Because of the sacred baths which devotees came to take and the rituals accompanying them which involved large crowd movements the whole life of the area was intimately bound up with bodies of water  the Ayya ku am at the heart of the town and other tanks on its outskirts. ",Thailand

" The Sociological Pattern of the Temple ",Thailand
" The organization of one of the largest  iva temples is studied taking into account the temple epigraphy  Xth XVIth c.  and the changes brought about by British colonization and the modern legal system. The supposedly economic function of the temple as well as the concept of redistribution are reconsidered in the light of a study of the divinity s possessions and of the temple accounts in recent years. The investigation covers mostly the ritual services mainly priesthood temple management and patronage as well as the deity s status. At different levels the analysis tends to underline an ambiguity basically contradictory to the caste system hierarchy  whereas an asymmetrical relationship is ritually maintained between the priest and the sacrificer at the same time the possibility is affirmed for a Hindu of any caste to attain salvation in a direct relationship with the divinity. Through devotion and with a renouncer like self control man as an individual agent in the world is restored. From a sociological point of view this is having several implications  the priests are regarded as inferior to the non priestly Brahmins  power s image is relatively enhanced  sectarian movements have developed around spiritual masters. Moreover it turns out that Hinduism has contributed some of the basic elements towards the build up of democracy once the legal conditions for a modern State had been laid down. An introduction sets the temple under investigation within the variety of sacred places found at different levels of Hindu society. ",Thailand
" Compared with the other volumes of the collection which focus on Tiruva   malai as a sacred place the present one is the study of Tiruva   malai as an urban agglomeration. It is subdivided in two main parts together with a third shorter one which is not a conclusion but considers the question of defining what may be called a town in the Hindu past of South India. The first part of the volume written by C. Guilmoto a demographer concerns the modern city a t luk         t luk   headquarters of North Arcot District its recent development and its position within the urban network of Tamilnadu. Though Tiruva   malai remains a sacred place attracting thousands of Hindu pilgrims at the time of its K rttikai              festival this alone cannot account for the tremendous growth of the town since the end of the XIXth century. Today the structures and components of the city are fully connected with and dependent on the dynamics of urban growth that are at work all over Tamilnadu and India. ",Thailand
" C. Guilmoto s study is not a mere survey of a town. His broad aim is to understand the historical and geographical context behind the present development of Tiruva   malai. His contribution focuses on the characteristics of the town from various angles  regional geography demographic history urban social morphology and economic analysis. The convergence of these different but interrelated perspectives serves to develop a general framework in which it becomes possible to distinguish regional trends from Tiruvannamalai s idiosyncratic features. ",Thailand
" The first section is devoted to the description of Tiruvannamalai s regional setting in a semi dry area from the major irrigation zones. The regional agrarian structure with the transformations brought about by the introduction of groundnut as a new commercial crop had a direct impact on the prosperity of the town   an impact later enhanced by the development of well irrigation and rice cultivation. This study of the geographical and historical setting in itself explains how Tiruva   malai came to be described as an oasis in a urban desert. ",Thailand
" The main part of this section  I.A. 2  is however concerned with the detailed examination of the town s demographic evolution in relation to other historical changes affecting both Tiruva   malai and its sub region. Starting from the end of the XIXth century regular census data help us to delineate the main cycles of the town s demographic growth. In order to do that demographic statistics were analysed in a strict comparative way which allows to weigh carefully the respective importance of regional and urban factors  see Fig. 2 through 8 . During a first period  1881 1931  Tiruvannamalai s growth was rapid though erratic because of its vulnerability to the level of agricultural activities. In the 1960 s Tiruva   malai emerged from a long period of relative stagnation to become one of the State s most successful agricultural towns. Technological changes in its rural hinterland brought direct and indirect prosperity as well as large numbers of migrants to the city. ",Thailand
" The second section is a description of the town itself  first of its morphology  I.B  and secondly of its social areas  I.C . The town s structure derives firstly from the generic model of South Indian temple towns  a large central shrine with four converging streets and a perpendicular grid of streets around. The modern extension of the built up areas along the regional axes of circulation gives to the town a star shaped morphology a feature reinforced by peripheral industrial development. The link between residence and occupation remains to some extent related to caste membership. However important sociological and economic changes might have been since the beginning of the town s growth the temple and the old town s geometric structure still act as the guiding principle for the development of the urban space. This description of the urban morphology of Tiruva   malai is conforted by the point of view of an architect P. Pichard who analyses Tiruva   malai cadastral survey of 1927  I.B. 3  and also points out the centrality of the temple the density of the urban texture and the characteristics of built plots very long in proportion and further reduced by family partition typical of traditional settlements of people of good status in Tamilnadu. As to the previous periods the question remains open regarding the shifting and resettlement of the population surrounding the temple as the temple premises were considerably extended several times along the centuries. ",Thailand
" The morphological study is broadened by the analysis of the social composition of the town. It is worth recalling that the population of Tiruva   malai has increased tenfold within a hundred years which implies a considerable mingling of people in relation to the migratory flows. To supplement the general information provided by the census a rapid fieldwork inquiry was conducted at the street and house levels which made it possible to ascertain the approximative number of houses and households as well as other data pertaining to the main occupations social origins and to a limited extent only the regional origins of the population. Tiruvannamalai s present population is quite heterogenous and none of the largest j ti       c ti  or castes living in the surrounding region is numerically dominant  though inhabitants of agrarian origin constitute a majority they are further divided internally along social and regional as well as political and economic lines. Based on the memories of elderly informants and results of his own enquiries C. Guilmoto proposes two maps which can be compared to shed light on the development of social settlement in Tiruva   malai between circa 1910 and the 1980s. To a certain extent the social settlement remains segmented according to j ti and regional affiliations  particularly striking is the concentration of Muslims and that of Harijans who remain clustered in settlements  c ri        now called colonies  once at the limits of the town and now surrounded by newly built areas. However when the members of a j ti are scattered all over the municipal area socio economic factors tend to supersede the traditional settlement linked to caste identity. That also demonstrates the spatial articulation of social changes newly brought about by urban dynamics. ",Thailand
" The analysis of the economic activities of the town  I.D  presents the basic data for assessing the economic role of Tiruva   malai and its main actors. Whereas the industrial sector is limited to food processing  rice and oil mills  and to a few mechanical industries producing diesel and electrical pumps for agriculture the occupational structure shows clearly the importance of trade in the urban economy. The strength of the trading sector allows Tiruva   malai to play a crucial role in the economic relationships between the villages and within a large area of northern Tamilnadu especially because the town is a regional centre for the processing and distribution of agricultural produces. C. Guilmoto s analysis of the complementary functions of the wholesale market  mandi        ma  i   and the regulated market emphasizes the centrality of Tiruva   malai for a large area   a role which has limited the possible commercial development of the small surrounding towns. For Tiruva   malai is also the place where large part of the local merchants  customers is provided by what is called the floating population  the villagers of all the rural places round the city and the thousands of pilgrims thronging every year. With the help of its function as an interface between large rural areas and the urban economy Tiruva   malai has been able to benefit directly from the growing economic exchanges  traditional trading castes  mostly Hindu but with a significant Muslim component  and fractions of the better off local peasant castes were the first recipients of this prosperity. ",Thailand
" The last part of this chapter  I.E  aims at stressing the global spatial factor behind Tiruvannamalai s changing fortunes. For this purpose casting away the regional identity of the town would be misleading as its rural component has been part and parcel of its social and economic history. In the models based on the theory of central places towns are simply considered redistributive centers for their hinterlands and then ranked according to the number of their central functions. However this model is not very useful in the case of towns like Tiruva   malai whose growth is mainly the consequence of the transfer of agricultural surplus from the countryside to the town. The theoretical model presented here  based on gravity  aims at mapping various urban fields  Umlands  surrounding the main towns of northern Tamilnadu. It assumes that a town s attraction is a direct function of its demographic size. The map thus obtained  Fig. 26  attempts to sum up the various geographical settings of each urban umland. Differences are clearly related to the general economic orientation of the towns. With its very large umland  several t luks  Tiruva   malai as a classical type of agricultural market town stands apart from narrow urban regions relying on industrial activities. Its present upgrading to the level of a new district s headquarters is a testimony to its durable hegemony over large rural tracts of northern Tamilnadu. ",Thailand
" After this study of the town of Tiruva   malai as it has evolved since the late XIXth century involving many factors which have been analysed from different standpoints the second part of the book again focusses on Tiruva   malai as a sacred place but in this case the emphasis is on the geographical dimension of the sacred place through a study of the pilgrims. ",Thailand
" Based on a survey carried out by C. Guilmoto at the time of the festival of K rttikai in 1983 the first chapter  II. A C  attempts to estimate the importance of this festival by locking into the composition of pilgrims it attracts. Before analysing the results of this survey in a critical reading of the available literature C. Guilmoto gives an account of the main features and varieties of pilgrimages in India and in the Tamil tradition. There is no way to obtain a reliable estimate of the number of pilgrims attending religious festivals such as K rttikai in Tiruva   malai. The great majority of pilgrims come from the North and South Arcot districts and two thirds of them are villagers. Most of them belong to castes of peasant origins. Least numerous are pilgrims of Brahmin castes and Harijans. Regarding occupation 54  of the surveyed pilgrims belonged to the non agricultural sector and among them those who are engaged in trade or business are numerically important as already observed in other sacred places in India. If we take into account the high proportion of literate or well educated pilgrims it appears that those coming from wealthy peasant classes and from urban middle castes  excluding Brahmins  constitute a significant substratum of Tiruvannamalai s pilgrims. All these informations help to locate the site of Tiruva   malai in the hierarchy of South Indian sacred places. ",Thailand
" Another important feature of pilgrimage places are the pilgrims boarding houses choultries  cattiram             called madam       ma am   sanskrit  matha monastery  at Tiruva   malai  III. A D . 113 madam have been registered in the municipality out of which more than the three quarters are still functioning institutions. Also included in this census are monasteries with a spiritual leader hermitages  often founded around the tomb samadhi of a guru  and a few charitable institutions but 75  of the total are simple choultries each associated with a caste  Tabl. 25 . These madam are mostly located  Fig. 30  along the procession routes of the temple divinity. Many of them were founded or renovated at the end of the XIXth century as is the case of the wealthiest of them built by the Nattukkottai Cettiyar of Ramnad who at that time financed the renovation of the temple at Tiruva   malai   as they did in many other sacred places of Tamilnadu. Though the growth of the town has probably contributed to the increase in the number of madam this kind of institution is quite old and historically attested. The madam vary in size and type of building  some are simply an open space for resting many are houses of a usual type a few are well built with a sanctuary  III. A  Fig. 31 35 . A characteristic feature is the emphasis given to the dining area and therefore to the giving of food. The madam is in a way a festive space related to the ceremonies of the temple. ",Thailand
" As a boarding house every madam usually belongs to a group of people members of one caste and in most cases of one of its subdivisions who have inherited the right to occupy the madam as well as the duty to maintain it and to perform the religious charities  dharma  established by the founder. M.L. Reiniche s study analyses the diverse incomes of the madam  coming increasingly from various kinds of rents  and the religious purposes of the endowment  III. B   C . These issues raise several questions concerning the nature of such an institution whose material form is a building which cannot be sold and which consists of hereditary rights and duties as defined by the vow of the founder and supposed to be everlasting. There is also something of a paradox in the fact that in most cases the present right owners of a choultry constitute one segment of a caste although the madam was usually founded on an individual initiative. In the case of monasteries or hermitages there is always at the origin of the institution one individual who has renounced the world and become a spiritual head for a community of disciples  even in that case the present spiritual head may belong to a lineage of gurus  comparable to a descent line from father to son  while the disciples even if socially mixed keep some loose links through caste status and regional origin. The case of a choultry is comparable  at the origin there is an individual a devotee of the presiding deity of Tiruva   malai. who came from elsewhere and decided to found a choultry in order to have a place to stay near the sacred centre and to perpetuate his devotion through an endowment. It is then possible to follow in theory the evolutive pattern of a madam  the choultry with the duties attached to the endowment is inherited by the founder s sons or very close relatives  it may then remain the very private concern of the founder s descendants but it will more usually become the concern of the latter s locality group. Then through relations of kinship and alliance the rights and duties connected with the madam are extended to the caste segment. As a further development the madam may be taken under the control of the modern association of the caste  sa gha         ca kam   and then virtually every member of the caste has a right on the madam. In the latter case however the caste members living in Tiruva   malai have the direct control over the madam  whereas in all other cases the control remains in the hands of people living outside the sacred centre which they visit at the time of the festival when they stay at the madam. ",Thailand
" The last section  III. D  is the comparative analysis of the different types of choultries in relation to caste kinship and territorial settings of their members. On the basis of the information obtained from fieldwork maps have been drawn  Fig. 37 44  representing the territorial areas associated to the Tiruva   malai choultries according to castes or caste segments. From the global map  Fig. 44  it appears that the potential pilgrims having some rights on a madam located at Tiruva   malai originate from all over Tamilnadu  however the attraction of the sacred place is primarily important for the area and the t luks immediately surrounding Tiruva   malai and then for the North Arcot district. These results are compared with those from C. Guilmoto s survey  II. B C . Some other territorial distinctions are also pinpointed according to caste  castes of peasant origin versus traders  castes . It may be argued further that this analysis of choultries and the phenomenon of caste which presents itself in diverse modes makes evident that what is known as caste actually does not exist in itself  if not only as an abstract administrative category  but that it exists through the variable formations of small groupings. The geographical corollary is that each caste segment in its relation to the sacred place through a madam is located in a discontinuous area more or less delimited and shared by the territorial areas of other social groupings. The sum of these areas constitutes a potential network of relationships between Tiruva   malai place and an extended but discontinuous territory. ",Thailand
" The third part of the volume is an attempt to understand how and on what grounds a locality may be characterised as urban in a given socio historical context. Having analyzed the town of Tiruva   malai from various points of view and considered particularly its demographic and economic development is it at all justified to consider Tiruva   malai a town in the past that is before the British administration made it the headquarters of a t luk  More generally how could we define a precolonial town in South India  ",Thailand
" From the above analysis we may deduce that the urban status of Tiruva   malai is demonstrated by the geographical extent of its attraction from the demographical and economic point of view as well as from the socio religious one. Put it in another way the geographical extent of various networks of relationships centered on a locality confers on it an urban dimension. If we now consider the topographical information provided by the temple inscriptions of Tiruva   malai from the Xth to the XVIth c.  from which maps have been drawn  see Fig. 45 50  and the large geographical extent of Tiruva   malai relationships at various periods of time it seems logically possible to deduce that Tiruva   malai was already a town in the precolonial past. However the epigraphical information conveys only the point of view of the temple and almost nothing can be directly inferred about the urban nature of the human settlement around it. ",Thailand
" So in the next analysis are set forth first from a reading of the inscriptions some clues relevant to the subject  and secondly the potential role of a temple in conferring an urban dimension to its surroundings as seems to have been the case for Tiruva   malai  always admitting that a temple alone does not make a town if certain other conditions are not present . Finally a few hypotheses are stated in relation to the example of Tiruva   malai as one possible model of precolonial South Indian towns. ",Thailand

" Chidambaram Town  Chit Ambalam  the atmosphere of wisdom  . Head quarters of the t luk of the same name in South Arcot District Madras situated in 11  25  N. and 79  42  E. on the South Indian Railway. The population in 1901 was 19909 of whom 18627 were Hindus and 1.191 Musalm ns. A municipality was constituted  S. 219  in 1873. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902 3 averaged Rs. 24800 and Rs. 25100 respectively. In 1903 4 they were Rs. 25800 and Rs. 27600 the former consisting chiefly of the proceeds of the taxes on houses and land. An estimate for a water supply amounting to Rs. 282000 is now under consideration. ",Thailand
" During the Carnatic Wars Chidambaram was a place of considerable strategic importance. In 1749 the ill fated expedition under Captain Cope against Devikottai halted here on its retreat to Fort St. David. In 1753 the French occupied it. In 1759 an attempt by the English failed but it capitulated to Major Monson in 1760. Later on Haidar Al  improved the defences and placed a garrison in the great temple. In 1781 Sir Eyre Coote attacked the temple but was driven off. ",Thailand
" Chidambaram is principally famous for its great  iva temple. This covers an area of 39 acres in the heart of the town and is surrounded on all four sides by streets about 60 feet wide. It contains one of the five great li gams namely the  air li gam  which is known also as the Chidambara Rahasyam or the   secret of Chidambaram.  No li gam actually exists   but a curtain is hung before a wall and when visitors enter the curtain is withdrawn and the wall exhibited the  li gam of air  being of course invisible. The temple is held in the highest reverence throughout Southern India and Ceylon and one of the annual festivals held in December and January is largely attended by pilgrims from all parts of India. As an architectural edifice it is a wonderful structure for it stands in the middle of an alluvial plain between two rivers where there is no building stone within 40 miles   and yet the outer walls are faced with dressed granite the whole of the great area enclosed by the inner walls is paved with stone the temple contains a hall which stands on more than 1000 monolithic pillars into the gateways are built blocks of stone 30 feet high and more than 3 feet square and the reservoir which is 150 feet long and 100 feet broad and very deep has long flights of stone steps leading down to the water on all four sides. The labour expended in bringing all this and other material 40 miles through a country without roads and across the Vell r river must have been enormous. ",Thailand
" The temple contains five Sabhas or halls besides shrines to Vish u and Ga e a. Its age and architecture are discussed at some length in Fergusson s History of Indian Architecture which also contains several woodcuts of different parts of it. The N ttukottai subdivision of the Chetti caste have recently been restoring the building at considerable cost. It possesses no landed endowments and is managed in a most unusual way by the members of a sect of Br hmans called D kshitars who are peculiar to Chidambaram and depend entirely upon public offerings for their own maintenance and for the upkeep of the temple. The management may be described as a domestic hierarchy each male  S. 220  married member of the sect possessing an equal share in its control. No accounts are kept. The D kshitars take it in turns to perform the daily worship. Except the temple the place contains little of interest. There is a resthouse built by a N ttukottai Chetti in which poor pilgrims are fed daily and many other resthouses provide accommodation for travellers. A high school in the town is managed by the trustees of the well known Pachayyappa charities. ",Thailand

" Inscriptions belonging to Kul ttu ka III s time are very numerous. This seems to get support from the fact that our collection of epigraphs from this single temple includes as many as forty nine items attributable to the period of reign of Kul ttu ka III the successor of R j dhir ja II. According to Prof. Sastri the former s relationship with the latter if any is not clear36. The same author in another context categorically states that it is quite impossible that Kul ttu ka III was one of the children of R jar ja said to have been one and two years old at the time of his death   for he came to the throne in A.D. 1178 within six years after R jar ja s death and took an active part in the war of P   yan Succession which had begun while R jar ja was still living. The evidence of Kul ttu ga  K vai and  a karac  a  ul  also points to the same conclusion37. But while examining the most important record from Pallavar ya  p   ai the A.R.E 1923 24 pp. 103 04 confidently says that the two children of 1 and 2 years of age were the children of R jar ja II and being an infant Kul ttu ka III the son of R jar ja II did not succeed his father immediately. This was accepted in 1957 itself by T.V. Sadasiva Pandarattar who has also categorically stated that Kul ttu ka III was the son of R jar ja II38. He has also accepted and stated that R j dhir ja II was the grandson of Vikrama c  a39. That the date of accession of R j dhir ja II may be A.D. 1166 has already been suggested as the probable one by Prof. Sastri40 although his ignoring of the other facts is difficult to understand. So the recent re study of the problem after an elaborate examination of the Pallavar ya  p   ai  S. 16  epigraph is good in so far as it goes to confirm the earlier views and for stating that R j dhir ja II was the son of R jar ja II s sister named Ne iyutaipperum 41.

" Kul ttu ka III ruled for forty years and his records upto that year are known. But in our collection records belonging to the regnal years 2 to 35 excepting those of the years 7 to 9 12 15 16 22 23 31 and 34 are available. One of the second year  87  commencing abruptly with the name of the king V rar c ntirac  at var which was attributed by others to V rar jendra of A.D. 1067 is included here for the reasons stated above  see p. 20 . Another epigraph of the 11th year  94  is included here just because the title of Tripuvana V rac  at var of the king occurs in it although the king is stated to have borne the title only from his 24th year42 and that the astronomical details preserved by this record were found by Kielhorn not to work out correctly for this reign43. Amongst the epigraphs under study only one genuine record  128  of the 35th year contains the title Tiripuvanav rat var. One epigraph  131  which does not preserve the date particulars but containing the name V rar c ntirac  at var coupled with the title Tiripuvanaccakkaravattika  is included on the basis of the title44. Two inscriptions  132 133  engraved one on each wall of the Ki i g pura which are in Sanskrit and in the Grantha script of the 12th century find a place here in spite of the fact that they do not contain the name of the king or any other particulars relating to him on the assumption that Mantr  vara Bh skara who according to the epigraphs was responsible for the coming into existence of the g pura  g pur  daya kara am  and was an important Mantri of Kul ttu ka III. As shown below  see chapter on Buildings Works  the g pura along with the enclosure wall and other adjuncts associated with it might have come into existence by the 2nd year of the king s reign because of the existence on its wall of the 2nd year record  87  already referred to.

This means who was pleased to take Maturai   am and the crowned head of the P   iya. The occurence of this single title amongst his 49 inscriptions dealt with here gives room to infer that the king valued the achievements mentioned here as important and characteristic of his regime while the other ones were of an ephemeral nature46.

" The villages of Sylt ",Thailand
" Twelve places each possessing a distinctive character. ",Thailand
" 25 miles of finest sandy beaches. Rough surf on the west coast the calm Wadden Sea with its tidal flats to the east. Unspoilt dunes and green dykes. Flowering heathlands and majestic cliffs. Daydreams and nightlife. Bustling activity and peaceful seclusion. Twelve places all of them different and each holding its own individual charm. ",Thailand
" The twelve villages of Sylt ",Thailand
" List on Sylt ",Thailand
" Blooming heathland frames white dunes and fishing cutters sway on the waves in the harbour. A walk around this headland is a sporting challenge in a stunningly beautiful landscape  List is in the truest sense the highpoint in the north. ",Thailand
" List s charming little harbour unites a vibrant atmosphere and maritime flair. The famous fish sandwich is still eaten on the go   but nowadays it s savoured against the backdrop of the newly designed harbour area with views across to Denmark. How fast do shifting sand dunes move  How do seabirds survive in a storm  Answers to these and many more questions can be found at the adjacent Erlebniszentrum Naturgewalten  Forces of Nature Exhibition . If after the buzz of the harbour you crave the tranquillity of deserted beaches all you have to do is follow the beacons of the two lighthouses which will guide you to the beach at the Lister Ellenbogen. ",Thailand
" List is not only the northernmost tip of the island. It is in fact the northernmost point of Germany itself. And that s not the only superlative offered by List. You ll find Germany s only shifting sand dune here and nowhere will you find fresher oysters  in Germany s only oyster farm between two and three million of these delicious molluscs are harvested every year. ",Thailand
" Kampen ",Thailand
" Art and culture nightlife and legends are united under thatched roofs. The lighthouse appears in a black   white robe and the Red Cliff shines in the evening sun  Kampen is Sylt s elegant address   and with good reason. ",Thailand
" Small but exquisite. Select yet open. Stylish yet charming. This is Kampen probably Germany s most famous village made popular over the past decades by its numerous well known visitors who come here for the unique natural scenery  fragrant heather and the tidal mudflats of the Wattenmeer to the east and the wild waves of the North Sea and fine sandy beaches to the west. Kampen gracefully combines tradition and the modern age. ",Thailand
" It is a place to explore music and literature and to be seduced by sublime nature  the incomparable golden glow of the Red Cliff at sunset. The legendary  Whisky Mile with its famous clubs is an eye catcher. Life moves to a unique rhythm here at any time of day or night whether it s for a romantic dinner or a party till sunrise. Germany s northernmost golf course is an unmissable treat  tee off within view of the Kampen lighthouse and the tidal mudflats. ",Thailand
" Wenningstedt Braderup ",Thailand
" Whether it s cruising through golden fields on a bicycle or galloping across green meadows on horseback. Whether it s leisure on the broad sandy beach or fierce competition on the mini golf course  this community is the island s family seaside resort. ",Thailand
" The twin community of Wenningstedt Braderup is especially popular with families. A wide range of fun activities including exploring the tidal mudflats of the Wattenmeer and a children s circus for aspiring acrobats are all aimed at the island s youngest visitors. Wenningstedt is built around the idyllic village pond and the Frisian chapel. It s delightfully pointless to argue which is more beautiful  the sunrise over the sprawling heathland and the golden fields of Braderup or the breathtaking spectacle of the setting sun at the western beach   why not take the time to enjoy both  ",Thailand
" Spend the day sunbathing on the white sandy beach of Wenningstedt and kick off the evening with a glass of red wine as you relax in your Strandkorb wicker beach chair or dine al fresco in one of the charming beach side bistros which serve fresh fish caught that very day. A visit to the Naturzentrum in Braderup will give you an impression of the vibrant life on both sides of the island  activities on offer include guided walks and cycle tours. The herb garden tours usually end in the midst of brightly coloured poppies and fragrant herbs with a cup of home made herbal tea. ",Thailand
" Munkmarsch ",Thailand
" At the small marina white masts rise into the sky the tides dictate the rhythm and a gentle breeze lightly whiffs over the mudflats  Munkmarsch is Sylt s maritime idyll. ",Thailand
" If you stroll along the mudflats today and enjoy the tranquility of Munkmarsch Bay it seems hardly conceivable that this cosy village was once the gateway to the island  until construction of the Hindenburgdamm in 1927 summer visitors could only reach Sylt by sea. Steamships from the mainland set course for the Munkmarsch harbour and from there people travelled further per island railway. As one can imagine proceedings during that time where rather exuberant whereas today you can leave your cares behind and savour the serenity of Munkmarsch   or the flavour of the many specialties in one of its gourmet restaurants. ",Thailand
" Now that the small private marina provides a landing stage for sailboats the bay has become an idyll which is also gladly utilised by surfers. If you want to give it a go and make your first windsurf attempts you ll find an ideal area here in the protected harbour. And from the water you also have the most fantastic view of the White Cliff that extends northwards along the mudflats. Be inspired by the maritime lightness and experience the most natural of all anti stress treatments. ",Thailand
" Westerland ",Thailand
" The island s heart beats right at its centre. With charm and laughter the island s capital unites urbane elegance with maritime buoyancy. Westerland is outright pure zest for life. ",Thailand
" Pamper your taste buds with culinary diversity  matjes herring oysters award winning cuisine and beach side bistros   there s something here for all tastes. Enjoy the thrilling spectacle of the Windsurfing World Cup take your team to victory at beach volleyball or enjoy exciting family adventures like beach expeditions pulling faces at the sharks from behind the safety of the aquarium glass or tossing yourself into the waves of the Sylter Welle indoor swimming pool with its spectacular views across the North Sea. ",Thailand
" Enjoy the same view as you are pampered with Ayurvedic oil massages or attend Qi Gong classes. A glass front turns the studio on the roof of the Syltness Center into a panorama lounge. The adjoining sauna complex set amid the dunes is too beautiful for only a brief visit. Once you ve recharged your batteries you can explore the island in all its diversity  whether by car or bus by bike or on foot with your  Nordic Walking sticks   Westerland s central location makes it the ideal starting point for excursions. Listen to concerts performed against the magnificent backdrop of the North Sea lose track of time while shopping conquer the surf on your surfboard and unwind in your Strandkorb  Westerland is the perfect place for all this and more. ",Thailand
" Tinnum ",Thailand
" Families particularly enjoy the island thanks to a wide range of activities for children. Centrally located in the middle of the island Sylt can be comfortably explored in all directions from here  Tinnum is the bridge between town and countryside. ",Thailand
" Tinnum actively combines the urbane and the rural. The well developed bike paths through the meadows offer wide views and the cycling friendly central location on the island brings all other Sylt villages closer. E bikes that provide built in tailwind are available for rent. And Tinnum also provides exciting tours for hikers and walkers. Tinnum Castle is a popular destination  the mighty circular rampart probably served as a cult site and later also provided a hiding place for buccaneers. You will find considerable freedom for individual arrangement of your holiday in a location   in the middle of the island   where town and countryside unite and horse drawn carriages roll through the green landscapes. And the sea is close in any direction  ",Thailand
" Keitum ",Thailand
" Frisian houses in the shade of old trees accommodate gastronomic and handcrafted treasures and the splendour of bygone times mixes with the colourful radiance of blooming gardens  Keitum is the Frisian jewel on the mudflats. ",Thailand
" While walking through winding paths and hidden trails you will be repeatedly fascinated by idyllic spots and stop in front of picturesque gardens. Former  captain s houses are strung together framed by traditional Frisian dry stone walls and chestnut beech and linden trees that are hundreds of years old. The shop windows under the thatched roofs of exclusive boutiques invite visitors to go for a stroll while cosy tearooms entice with home baked pastries and galleries exhibit works by insular and international artists. Outstanding chefs reinterpret Frisian dishes and creative artisans give traditional jewellery production a finishing touch here. ",Thailand
" If you are on the go in search of the chequered history of the village you will encounter Sylt s lifestyle culture of the 18th century in a very lively manner in the  Old Frisian House and discover many treasures in the local museum s extensive collection. Incidentally you can not only experience Saint Severinus Sylt s oldest church with your eyes  the organ concerts are staffed with top class international musicians who are known far beyond the island s borders. But despite all the variety you should always do one thing  walk along the mudflats   your mind will be beautifully clear. ",Thailand
" Archsum ",Thailand
" Lush green meadows stretch to the horizon and allow lots of room for the broad sky and crystal clear North Sea air. Nature predetermines the rhythm here  Archsum is the island s green haven of tranquility. ",Thailand
" In the smallest village on the island you will experience rural idyll and agricultural tradition  sheep graze on green meadows a small stream meanders through the countryside and yellow rapeseed fields glow in the spring sky. Old farmhouses sit enthroned on their dwelling mounds and thatched Frisian houses dominate the view. Here there is plenty of room for wide vistas and extensive bicycle tours through salt meadows and along dikes. ",Thailand
" Here you can discover the diversity of flora and fauna and very intensively experience the change of seasons   from sowing to harvest from the soft green spring awakening to snow covered glittering winter days. Between salt meadows and sea you will find tranquility and are nevertheless so close to the colourful island life. Enjoy this luxury of nature in deep breaths. ",Thailand
" Morsum ",Thailand
" The impressive Morsum Cliff with magnificent rock formations shines on the easternmost tip of the island and traditions of lively everyday life are set amidst blooming heathland and lush meadows  Morsum is the island s rural gem. ",Thailand
" If you ever want to walk through the geological history of the past 10 million years you should walk along Morsum Cliff. The over 20 metres high rock formation extends for 1800 metres. It is due to Ice Age displacements that the layers which rest in the darkness of the earth elsewhere shine in various colours in the rising sun  black mica clay red limonite sandstone and white kaolin sand. Fantastic views of the mudflats and the thatched Frisian houses of the cosy village are repeatedly opened up to you during hikes through the broad heathland. ",Thailand
" And if you do not know why  gallows are necessary on Sylt the natives of Morsum   who have fostered the tradition of  Ringreiten   Ring Riding  to this day   will gladly provide information whether it is while you enjoy a piece of homemade Frisian torte or during events in the  Muasem H s   Morsum House  the centre of the village. Set off in search of the roots of the island s history   living  sprouts  still grow here. ",Thailand
" Rantum ",Thailand
" Between the seas there is room for old sagas and young artists. Culture and nature are closely interwoven here. It s also just a short distance from the mudflats to the North Sea surf  Rantum is Sylt s narrow waist. ",Thailand
" This small Frisian village with its thatched cottages is surrounded by many legends. In the dunes of Rantum historical tales were born as were young gastronomic legends. The atmosphere is easygoing jeans and tweed meet trainers and high heels   everyone savours the treasures of excellent cuisine and wine cellars while enjoying the sea view. Wherever you decide to treat yourself in the evening don t miss a trip to the small marina and fish smokehouse. As well as offering smoked delicacies the marina is surrounded by nature and culture. ",Thailand
" You re never far from the beach in Rantum which lies at Sylt s narrowest point. Charming thatched cottages perch attractively on the dunes between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea with views across the waves andalways close to the heart of the island s magic. And the beach  It stretches for miles in the west and is only a few hundred metres away from the quiet mud flats in the east. You re never far from the beach in Rantum which lies at Sylt s narrowest point. Charming thatched cottages perch attractively on the dunes between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea with views across the waves and always close to the heart of the island s magic. ",Thailand
" H rnum ",Thailand
" Two seas lap around the broad sandy beach and collide on the southernmost tip of the island while the lighthouse guides walkers and excursion ships along the right paths  H rnum is Sylt s sunny south. ",Thailand
" Surrounded by gorgeous beaches and fragrant rose bushes. Watched over by the red and white lighthouse   which is worth climbing up to immerse yourself in Sylt s history or even tie the knot amongst a small circle of friends. Love with wonderful prospects including views across to the neighbouring islands the shimmering Wattenmeer the North Sea waves and the endless horizon. There are so many things to do here. ",Thailand
" Set off on a boat trip  excursion boats leave several times a day for the seal banks and neighbouring islands. If you want to control the rudder yourself head off to the Sylt Catamaran Club or the Sylt Yacht Club. The new golf course located at the foot of the dunes is perfect for practicing your stroke or simply enjoy a relaxing walk around the Odde. If you re travelling with children the wide eastern beach with its shallow shore is a true paradise. And if you want to know what exactly it is you have discovered in the sand or mud the mud flats preservation centre Schutzstation Wattenmeer will provide the answers. No matter which direction you ve come from the outlook in Sylt s south is always sunny. ",Thailand

" Abstract ",Thailand
" Dragons are portrayed in widely separated cultures as simultaneously male and female. While this trait may appear arbitrary its global distribution implies that it is motivated by observations available to all humans. Many seemingly arbitrary traits of dragons are shared by conceptions of the rainbow which is widely portrayed as having both male  primary  and female  secondary  arcs. This correlation of features in mythical and natural counterparts shows that the nineteenth century doctrine of naturalism which saw various elements of myth and folklore as reflecting features of the natural world was valid despite excesses that eventually caused its abandonment.

" Wilhelmsburg Ulm ",Thailand
" The  Wilhelmsburg  was built from 1842 to 1849 as the Citadel s reduit. The Citadel comprised work XII of the  Wilhelmsburg  and works XIII to XVIII of Fort Wilhelm and was the largest of the town wall fortifications. In contrast to all the other works  the  Wilhelmsburg  had no ramparts and consisted only of four re inforced bunkers in the three towers. Over the decades different regiments and units were stationed here. ",Thailand
" After the Second World War the  Wilhelmsburg  was officially used as a refugee camp although several citizens of Ulm whose homes had been bombed or requisitioned also took shelter here. At any one time a total of almost 3000 people lived in the  Wilhelmsburg  which had its own shop post office and school. ",Thailand
" In 1956 the newly formed German army moved in and up until 1970 soldiers were still stationed in the bunkers of the  Wilhelmsburg . ",Thailand
" Since then the more than 570 rooms have been empty apart from a few that have been rented out to companies. ",Thailand
