"    A TERRIBLE STORM    ",China
" I felt a cold shiver all over my body. The wind was howling the leaves from the trees were rustling. I was all by myself caught in this storm. Nobody else was outside. They went inside to cover up from the storm. I heard the whoosh from the waves as they crash towards the shore. I knew it was going to be a long night. ",China
" I held myself tightly. In the distance I could see the storm terrorising the town up ahead. I could even hear the light pitter patter of the hail as it stormed down towards the ground. It was coming. The sky started to rumble really loudly. I saw a flash of lightning up ahead. I knew my parents were worried but I wasn t. I was as brave as could be. I charged through the rain getting totally soaked. Just a little rain wouldn t stop me. ",China
" Now the storm was getting really close. I closed my eyes just as another flash of lightning bolted down from the sky. The thunder rolled again for a really long time. Another lightning bolt came from the sky. A crackling sound of thunder made me shiver. I slowed down a bit so I could have a rest but not only for that reason  the storm was here. ",China
" I shielded my face from the terrible winds. I took a deep breath and got up again. I started to walk then jog and then I ran as fast as I could towards home. I stopped silently as the wind died down a bit but not for long. I couldn t see a thing the sky was so dark I couldn t see where I was going. As the sky cleared a bit I smelt the familiar smell. The rain was pitter pattering loudly. ",China
" As I looked in front of me I saw my home. I was finally safe and sound. ",China

" My name is Cassandra Mortmain I know it sounds made up but it s true. I m 17 and bright as a button and never been kissed because it s the 1930s. My family are effortlessly bohemian we all live in a crumbling castle   oh yes quite literally    and we have no money at all and we have only barely heard of the twentieth century. How poor we are since father stopped earning any money. He used to be a genius but now he does crosswords. We eat the occasional potato and scrape plaster off the walls My name is Cassandra Mortmain I know it sounds made up but it s true. I m 17 and bright as a button and never been kissed because it s the 1930s. My family are effortlessly bohemian we all live in a crumbling castle   oh yes quite literally    and we have no money at all and we have only barely heard of the twentieth century. How poor we are since father stopped earning any money. He used to be a genius but now he does crosswords. We eat the occasional potato and scrape plaster off the walls for pudding. We have thought of cooking one of our dogs but that would not do. Also something you should be aware of although you will find out pretty soon I believe is that I suffer from acute logorrhoea which is a debilitating condition that impels its victim to write a never ending journal into which is debouched every last possible banal but extremely charming detail of one s life and that of one s immediate family which is the pulchritudinous Rose my 21 year old sister my doughty schoolboy brother my poor damaged papa who wrote one brilliant book once but has since sunk into a kind of bewilderment and his nude model youngish wife the unusual lute playing nature communing Topaz whom we love immoderately in spite of her frank farfetchedness along with various cats and dogs with classically derived names and a servant boy called Stephen who gauchely is in love with my 17 year old preciousness and whom we do not pay but who contrives to be preternaturally handsome and work for us for free. Anyone might think I have made all this up out of my own coquettish head  ",China
" We may live in a literal castle but we haven t got the price of a loaf of bread. It s enough to make a cat laugh. Our situation is so wry that fairly broad comedy oozes from its very pores. Rose said only last night that she was quite up to walking the streets to earn a crust if she thought it would do any good but the quaint rural byways of the Suffolk countryside don t possess the required type of street. So here I am as usual sitting on something odd it could be a turret or a tuffet or a large mammal carefully noting down in my journal everything I hear and see along with the weather at the time and the precise location of the several animals we own what I am wearing and what my immediate family are wearing with various passing references to the utter beauty of the crumbling literal castle that we all inhabit over which the moon sheds its downy light and lambent whatnots.

" Four months later ",China
" Something has actually happened  Yes new owners of the mansion have taken possession   new neighbours  And it s just like a fairytale for they are none other than two handsome American bachelors with whom I and my sister will fall in love and they with ourselves naturellement. But not before many pages of microscopic examination of every trifling occurrence so that a single evening in their company will take 30 pages for me to detail and the sisterly debate about it another ten. And certainly not before much gentle yet sharply observed observations on the romantic yearnings of two beautiful yet penniless girls who get the brothers the wrong way round at first. Now let me explain how I first met the American brothers. I was in the bath and I had been dying clothes that day so my entire body was coloured a violent sea green and they wandered into the crumbling castle thinking no one could possibly live there. Imagine the scene  They took me for some kind of turtle. ...more ",China

I did not have to tell myself to be patient to wait for one plot line to play out because the book helpfully plied me with a pleasant drink while I waited. I did not feel done after it had given me a good meal because right before the last course it promised dessert. ",China
" The summary is accurate and pointless. It is about Cassandra writing about herself in a journal. Their family is penniless. They do live in a castle. She is as it promises deeply hopelessly in love. ",China
" But not with any of the men in the book. They re all intriguing in their own way don t get me wrong and she does love many of them in many different ways. The novel takes place in one of my favorite intellectual time periods to read and study and this book plays across all of its nuances  artists  models and intellectuals servants  quarters and vicars romanticism and mysticism the religion of church and the religion of a well turned out drawing room. But all of that is sort of beyond the point. The point is that Cassandra is deeply hopelessly in love with life and her utter wry engagement with the castle she adores is what pulled me through the pages. Her voice is kind and self deprecating generous and wondering. The humans she observes   Topaz her often nude step mother  Rose her selfish and hungry sister  Mortmain her once famous father   are all seen through this well meaning gaze and even terrible events are colored with love  even when I thought characters could do with a polite punch in the mouth .

I m not exaggerating here    this book will charm the pants off you especially if you happen to have two X chromosomes and a bad case of Anglophilia. It s what would happen if an early twentieth century Jane Austen were to grow up in a dilapidated castle and get into financial trouble and that s all I m going say about it except that I want to be Cassandra Mortmain when I grow down.

" This 1948 novel is about an intelligent 17 year old girl Cassandra Mortmain who lives in semi genteel but crushing poverty in mid 1930s England in a dilapidated castle. Cassandra has ambitions of becoming an author like her father. Her story is told in the form of her journal entries as she practices her writing skills to try to learn to capture  the castle as well as the people in her life in her writing. ",China
" Cassandra skillfully describes her father s distance and failure to do anything to provide for the family her stepmother s charm and eccentricity and her older sister Rose s despair at their isolation and poverty. But what broke my heart was her matter of fact descriptions of how their poverty affects their lives every day  the too small worn out clothing the girls have to wear  her gratitude for having eggs along with bread and margarine for their evening meal  the way the girls trade off sleeping in the one comfortable bed in their room  which hasn t been sold only because it s in such bad shape . Rose the more beautiful sister is grimly determined to escape from poverty even if she has to marry a man she doesn t love. When two young American brothers move into town  the older son Simon is the family s new and wealthy landlord  the Mortmains  lives are all turned topsy turvy with love romance and secrets. ",China
" Cassandra s insights into own and others  personalities and motivations are sharp and witty and occasionally even a little prophetic  I think the symbolism of her name from Greek mythology is deliberate although she misses at least one major secret that a member of her own family is hiding. The characters are believable and human sometimes frustratingly so with their flaws. I particularly wanted to smack Cassandra s father upside the head  he s a well known author with one famous book to his credit but for the last ten years he s been struggling with a massive case of writer s block hiding away in his home office reading detective novels and working on crosswords while his family sells the furniture to survive. ",China
" I thought there were just a few missteps in the story  the chain of unrequited love interests was pushing the boundaries of believability  woman wants boy who loves girl who loves another guy who loves another girl who loves  . I guessed one big reveal at the end fairly early in the story. Cassandra spends a chapter or two examining her views on religion and talking to the local vicar and then never mentions it again which made me wonder why it was included in the first place. ",China
" But these are minor flaws. Cassandra is an enchanting character and a fantastic narrator surrounded by some unforgettable characters. This is a lovely bittersweet novel that doesn t go for the easy resolution. ...more ",China

" The narrator who is consciously attempting to capture in her journal her family s eccentric and impoverished life in their unfurnished deteriorating castle home is simply enchanting. The book is very much about writing  the seventeen year old protagonist Cassandra aspires to be a writer and her strange father rose to fame through the art  and Smith weaves a tale full of wit and charm. As I read I was struck by the tension between my desire to read quickly to watch the story unfold and my desire to savor each delightful description and thoughtful reflection. ",China
" The novel took me completely by surprise when it shifted tone near its middle. I realize now that the early parts of the novel were the records of a carefree and intelligent child and that in the later parts the child must begin to grow up. I as a reader felt the burden of her maturing outlook. It felt like a nineteenth century Romance was smacked upside the head with Modernist Realism. And I think Smith was going for that. She warned me partway through.  I didn t want to listen.  The early parts of the book were sprinkled with allusions to Austen and the Bronte sisters while the latter half was more preoccupied with Cassandra s father s clearly Modernist work. There was more rural country in the beginning and more city life at the end. Even a shift in discussion of art from Topaz s paintings and lute to Stephen s photographs and films. So I guess it had to have a more realistic end. Though Austen wouldn t have ended the book the way I d have liked it to end anyway  Robert Martin may be suitable for Harriet Smith but even the best of his class wouldn t have been acceptable for Emma. And perhaps even Emma could not have been taught to deserve one such as he. ",China

" It is difficult for me to say why I found I Capture the Castle so personally meaningful which may mean that I will be falling all over myself in this review.

When I first started reading I was bored and feared that the poverty of the characters would become dirty and depressing for its own sake as in Angela s Ashes. Instead it s more like a lovely BBC movie where people are always chewing with their mouth open but somehow it is only charming. At first I resisted liking anything about it including Cassandra s repeated use of the word capture but now I find myself thinking about how to describe this or that and involuntarily using the word capture in my thoughts. The story is at times screwball and at times elegant but always delightful and completely won me over. ",China
" Perhaps part of the reason I resisted this book is that I came to it thinking it would be romance  because of the movie poster cover of the book which says something like A well loved classic that has become the most romantic movie of the year   hate those movie poster covers  but it is actually more than anything a coming of age story. I say this because I think that whether you prefer coming of age or romance it helps to know what you re getting into when you start a book. In my experience romantic novels solve the problems of life by bringing characters together in true love. I Capture the Castle is written through Cassandra s eyes so it does not rely on romantic satisfaction to tell the story as perhaps it would have if it were told by another character in the same book. Rather like any good coming of age story develops through revelations of the unreliability of people around Cassandra and her discovery her own independence and capabilities. I must confess that what first hooked me on this book was Simon s beard. I have said that I am a sucker for a good fish story and it turns out that I think I am a sucker for a good beard story too. I thought the girls  fascination and horror over his beard were both hilarious and correct. I wonder why I don t see beards in stories more often. Really when anyone I have known has a beard it comes up in conversation almost any time the person is mentioned   and rightly so. I once asked a friend of mine who had a bushy beard before he met his fiance why he would have chosen to grow it out like that. He said that the reason any man who can grow a big bushy beard should is that the bigger your beard the more authority you have over people in general and specifically over other men. He said there is something almost magical about having a big bushy beard that makes other people have to do whatever you want. I told him that was absolutely silly. Then about a week later I was at the grocery store deciding which line to go through and one of the checkers who was otherwise very ordinary looking had an enormous bushy beard. I instinctively went to his line and then a second later was shocked to realized that I had only done that because of the beard. I don t know if that proves my friend s point but it has to mean something. I wonder if the castle girls weren t experiencing something like this beard hypnosis in the beginning of the novel. ",China
" To go ahead and beat this beard point to death  I also thought it was lovely how Dodie Smith developed the beard s story. I always see authors showing the physical changes love supposedly brings to women but not men. The women are pale and thin until they fall in love when suddenly they become healthy looking. In I Capture the Castle Simon looks suspiciously like Satan until he falls in love and shaves the beard. Brilliant  Also it has the self serving overtones of Elizabeth Bennet s visit to Pemberly in Pride and Prejudice when the mansion shows Mr. Darcy s manners in a different light. Beardless Simon makes even his actions when bearded much less sinister. Love it. ",China
" You may not believe me if you have read this far when I say that Simon s beard was not what was personally meaningful to me about this story. Not surprisingly I think it was Cassandra herself who seemed so profound. In many ways I did not identify with her but I loved her. I found myself crying at times not necessarily because her growing pains revealed my own but only in sympathy for this new friend I found who I love so much. I loved how wise and kind and scrappy she was. I actually loved every character in this novel though as they all had some kind of magical and hilarious individuality. It is tempting to copy some of the most beautiful moments here but instead I think you should just read the book. On the one hand I am sad that I did not read this in high school when I think it may have been a more cathartic experience but I wonder if its honesty might have hurt my feelings then. As it is I found it both refreshing and comforting. ...more ",China

I can t even hear Celia Johnson s accent in this bunch because they all seemed to whisper a lot even when they were apparently shouting. ",China
" What more can be said  I think it was an attempt to be satirical at the posh nobs in the same way Cold Comfort Farm was and maybe tried it s hardest to be a kind of new wave post Victorian classic saga of life and love but was also denouncing those flouncy writers who bloody loved the countryside too much how dare they when they lived in the Industrial Revolution and the countryside didn t even exist any more but sadly it was nothing but utter toilet bowl water. ...more ",China

" Here we have a potential recipe for a comedy of manners a farce a TV soap opera or even a Wodehouse ian extravaganza.

" For Cassandra Mortmain is truly a masterly creation. I would place her on the same pedestal on which I have put Elizabeth Bennet Becky Sharp and Scarlett O Hara  I have not read Jane Eyre but from what I have heard that redoubtable lady is of the same calibre . But Cassandra is not as accomplished determined or wicked  as in the case of Ms. Sharp and Ms. O Hara  as these legendary heroines   she is very much a teenage girl suffering all the confusions and tantrums of that difficult period of life. No what makes Cassandra special is her candour. ",China
" At one point in the novel unaware that she is listening in Simon wonders whether Cassandra is being consciously naive  i.e. putting it on as a show to attract people. She is incensed and rightly so  because if there is one thing to be said for the girl it is her perfect honesty about everything including herself  For example you have respect a person who can say that a piece by Bach made her feel that she was being repeatedly hit on the head by a teaspoon  ",China
" There are plenty of scenes worthy of Wodehouse   Topaz dancing at the foot of the castle tower at night in the buff and being taken for a ghost  Rose being chased across the country in a bearskin coat because people think that she is an escaped circus bear   but the hilarity does not slide into outright belly laughter as with his novels. As a counterpoint there are plenty of mellow scenes too where the novelist relies heavily on metaphor  Rose wishing on a gargoyle and Cassandra and Simon doing the Midsummer Eve rites at the foot of the Belmonte Tower to quote two examples .

What is jellied soup anyway  There was also a cutely Pollyannaesque tone to the cheerful way Cassandra would casually make note of all the things they lacked and had sold off and her appreciation for the little that they did have. But halfway through the book I stopped being able to fully relate to Cassandra. ",China
" I get that love isn t rational but sometimes I think what s true in real life doesn t always translate well to fiction. Stephen was really too wonderful and too deserving of love and I was just unable to process Cassandra s indifference to him as a lack of chemistry rather than utter heartlessness. He was responsible and considerate not only to Cassandra but to the entire family even though by the end he was their hired boy only in name and was the only one in the family earning any income. That anecdote about his reaction to the news of his mother s illness really did it. The scene with the wirelesses was especially painful and it was interesting to note Cassandra s perception of kindness  she is deeply impressed by and grateful to the Cottons for what she calls their kindness and I definitely get that given what a huge impact they ve had on her family s lives and circumstances. At the same time this really highlights how much she takes for granted in terms of the kindness she receives from Stephen Topaz and Miss Marcy. ",China
" In the end it almost seemed as though Cassandra s feelings were largely decided by both class and circumstance  i.e. her feelings towards a person were determined by what it is within their means to provide. For example Topaz can only cook and scrub and clean and comfort and Miss Marcy can go out of her way to provide somewhat insubstantial help while Mrs. Cotton can send gigantic hams and throw lavish parties and Simon with his age and access to education can talk about books and composers. When she tries to comfort Stephen she even acknowledges that his wireless was a bigger present from him because he had to work and save for it and I think that s pretty representative of their entire relationship with the Cottons  the Cottons are kind generous people but it also really doesn t cost them anything and they can afford such charity. I think the author did a good job of illustrating the selfishness and single mindedness that can come out of young love or infatuation. ",China
" Again this is all very realistic and makes sense since it s human nature to take what you have for granted to not appreciate family when you re starstruck or obsessed with something else but because this was fiction I wanted it all to wrap up neatly and for the main character to grow up. I don t mean the character shouldn t still be a work in progress at the end of book but in terms of character growth Cassandra s story and and Miss Marcy s story of being shaken out of her self interest by grief and tragedy and then coming out of that by taking an interest in children are at different ends of the spectrum. ",China
" I feel like the book offers the first part of a coming of age story without actually following the character through to any major development. Since the latter portion of the book has much more to do with Cassandra s emotions and her fixation on Simon than on the unique experience of living in poverty in a castle with an eccentric family this also made me lose some of my original interest in the book. ...more ",China

" Well I Capture the Castle is clearly not a book written for thirtysomething heterosexual males and I ll be damned if I knew what first compelled me to read it. I think I must have read some loving review written somewhere when it was reissued a while back    a loving review that probably completely mischaracterized the book    or I never would have picked it up. ",China
" Nevertheless even though it is better suited for 15 year old girls it really is a well written and charming novel told by a quite winning narrator. No it s not the right book for me but I did enjoy reading it for the most part. There were a few too many parts in which Cassandra our heroine moons over her love interest Simon for pages and pages and pages. I starting throwing up in my mouth a little bit during those parts but I just kept my head down and powered through and came out the other side I believe a better man. Look I read that brown shower of a book Twilight so I can take almost anything. And this is a far far far far better book than Twilight was    a million times better.  Dodie Smith unlike Stephenie Meyer actually speaks the English language.  In fact any 15 year old girl who wants to read a romance suitable for age and values her brain cells would be well advised to choose I Capture the Castle over Twilight. ",China
" OK sorry didn t meant to make this yet another anti Twilight screed. Anyway point is four stars for I Capture the Castle because even though I wasn t its targeted demographic it is well written and charming  I m still heterosexual even though I ve used the phrase well written and charming not once not twice but three times now  and all the haters can eat me.

Even the character who spoke those words soon preferred to take them back in favor of the fascinated love he felt towards the beauty of the Mortmains of Godsend Castle. I smiled upon my first acquaintaince with Miss Cassandra Mortmain laughed upon further conversation and felt as if I were there clasping hands with her in the shadows of her crumbling castle near all the way through. The book is an invocation of Gothic passion with all the repressed sensuality of the Bronte sisters and a beach ball of ever so practical British and Jane Austen wit being passed back and forth among the cast. It wraps us up in mingled dreams fantasies and reality and lets us decide which is truly which while we watch a family trying to do the same. It is a coming of age tale if one must categorize it but it was few and far between that I was reminded of that fact. While she does  put away childish things  one by one she lets us see that adults build their own worlds for themselves too no less silly or indulgent than that which she builds for herself. I do not know why this is rated as YA literature by some people here. I certainly would not have gathered everything that I did from this at the age of 13 or 14. Please don t let that suffice as a reason for you to pass this one up. Truly it will be a sad loss. ",China

It s not a lonely voyeur book but a loving one like those collections of stories and images and songs we store up to shield against the blackest stuff  or at least a rope to hold onto . I bought  Castle  in 2002 after reading a review on amazon that said it was a dark flip side of Elizabeth Bowen s The Death of the Heart  one of my favorite books . I ve never read another review that for me personally summed up this book better that I d want to read it  yes it is true that it is enjoyable and charming too . It is the lighter side of turning over rocks and sometimes finding creepy crawlies underneath. Of not getting hurt by building up love stories to cushion the harsh blows of day to day life. The secrets that make you know someone better and therefore love them better. Cassandra s scope changes and she learns to not make more or less out of everything but try and see it for what it is while still seeing the need for valuing it that much. Her father s past with their deceased mom his writer s block and being imprisoned in his own mind the step mom she took for granted the little brother who saw more than she thought he did being rich in more than money the selfish but passionate Rose her love Simon Stephen she took for a brother who really loved her all along... Some of my favorite parts were her conversations with the Vicar about her changing religious beliefs.  And like many others have written it is funny and charming and quaintly fresh. Just like making up stories in play time about living in a beautiful and rotted castle. With a moat of course. ...more ",China

" There is a neatly written section in which the vicar and Miss Marcy both casually encourage the stricken Cassandra to whom they are offering succour and comfort that is like water in a desert to her to take up their own interests  religion  you might like it. helping others  you might like it. Cassandra is tempted but then she decides that these characters are taking refuge from pain and thus from life itself in these absorbing pursuits. Cassandra even reflects that they are like children because they haven t really lived. The conclusion   that she should not throw herself into religion or good works   feels refreshing and appropriate to the form of a novel  a medium that draws or produces the subjectivity of the subject  but... really  The only real life is one devoted to pursuing the most fully felt personal joy and suffering  Is this the only way we can imagine self actualisation  I can t accept that autonomy requires the rejection of the mortar of community. When Cassandra receives help and then pities her helpers for helping it seems to me she affirms her class privilege even more thoroughly than her materialistic sister does when she counts her expensive new possessions.

" A castle is a defensive structure seen as one of the main symbols of the Middle Ages. The term has a history of scholarly debate surrounding its exact meaning but it is usually regarded as being distinct from the general terms fort or fortress in that it describes a residence of a monarch or noble and commands a specific defensive territory. Roman forts and hill forts were the main antecedents of castles throughout Europe which emerged in the 9th century in the Carolingian Empire. The advent of cannon and gunpowder in the mid 13th century changed the needs of warfare in Europe limiting the effectiveness of the castle and leading to the rise of the fort.

Picking up shortly after the end of Thunder Oak the novel centres on the anthropomorphised weasels searching for the humans that mysteriously vanished from their homeland many years before. Following a clue found in the first book the weasels led by the outlaw Sylver and pursued by the stoat Sheriff Falshed journey to a far away city where they find themselves entangled in a battle between rivalling clans of squirrels. Published in Germany under the title Belagert die Sturmburg. ",China
" After discovering the second clue to the whereabouts of the humans lies at the famed Castle Storm the outlaw weasels journey to the south of Welkin where the castle lies to discover more about the mysterious human evacuation. However a cascade of rats is swarming down from the marshes in the north of the island to seize power from Prince Poynt. ",China
" In the unnamed marshes in the north of Welkin the evil stoat lord Flaggatis plots to eradicate Prince Poynt s grip on power. He sends his evil rats to commence a massive war against the stoats. His main attack source is Castle Rayn home of the stoats but he also has other targets too  County Elleswhere home of Sylver s band and County Fearsomeshire home of Lord Ragnar. Prince Poynt and his stoats are overwhelmed  in their beds  as Flaggatis hopes but not before a ferret messenger is sent to Lord Haukin ruler of Halfmoon Wood. ",China
" In the wood Sylver s band corner the ferret and eventually when Sylver arrives they listen to his story. Lord Flaggatis has built a massive wooden god effigy more like a monstrous white rat than anything else. After hearing the ferret s alarming tale the weasels consider what to do and decide to support the stoats in their battle against the rats as the rats are the enemies of all of Welkin and the weasels start to travel to Castle Rayn. They eventually reach it although they have to contend with several cowardly stoat mercenaries upon the way who have deserted the war out of fear of the rats but eventually the cowardly stoat soldiers join the weasels to attack the rats. The weasels send Scirf and Mawk in to infiltrate the castle and they eventually enter but the weasels are captured by Prince Poynt in the process who throws them in his dungeons. Mawk the doubter convinces their guard to play a game of hollyhockers with him and appears to lose but later he reveals that he held the guard s key to the weasels  cell in his mouth all along. ",China
" After slipping through a grating cover the weasels worm their way down through the underground rivers and enter an otter colony where they meet Sleek an otter obsessed with fashion. Back at Castle Rayn Prince Poynt appears cleverer than he looks and tells Sheriff Falshed to follow the weasels and obstruct them in their quest. After allowing him to free them the weasels then enter an open lake where they meet their old friend Sheriff Falshed who has been knocked unconscious by the fall from the cliff. After contending with some rats and a giant dragonfly nymph carnivorous in nature  carnivorous meaning mammal eating rather than insect eating  Sheriff Falshed fakes amnesia and thus the weasels finally make their way to the castle leaving Sleek the otter to go his own way  to find a fashion industry . Sheriff Falshed fakes amnesia throughout the entire voyage to Castle Storm where the weasels meet a massive rivalry between the grey squirrels and the highly arrogant red squirrels. The red squirrels are led by Clive of Coldkettle who sports an extra large tail and the grey squirrels are led by Pommf de Fritte. The weasels are accepted by the reds and are shown around town by Clive where Sylver encounters a coven of moles who much to Sylver s alarm proclaim him to be Lord of Elleswhere. ",China
" The weasels are invited to a tournament where to their horror their friend Icham is killed by Torca Marda. Icham dies despite an attempt to revive him by a good stoat doctor. After a feast that night where the weasels meet two evil ferrets called Rosencrass and Guildenswine who plot to kill Prince Poynt and an extremely evil stoat called Torca Marda who killed Sylver s father. The weasels then journey down beneath the castle to search for the clue and narrowly avoid death when Torca Marda attempts to kill the weasels by resurrecting a badger although they kill the fiend by stabbing it with a raptor s claw. Then the dragonfly from the lake breaks out of its aquatic nature and attacks the castle devouring any creature in its path. The coven of moles still intent on Sylver being a lord suggest that they should feed the old and weak animals to the ravenous beast and Torca Marda agrees on this mad plan. ",China
" Wodehed the magician comes up with a solution to the problem of the dragonfly  they must journey to the Forest of Lost Birds and retrieve a secret herb known as Shatter from the goddess Sessile s garden. Sessile is a sentient tree and in her roots another dimension resides. On their way to the forest they run into and escape a group of birds who are obsessed with the idea of returning home to their island via a ship of Braeburns and then are attacked by Rosencrass and Guildenswine who upon revealing that they have murdered one of the birds are imprisoned in the trees of the Forest of Lost Birds. The weasels retrieve the herb return to Castle Storm and destroy the dragonfly whereupon it shatters into small harmless dragonflies. Torca Marda furious at this loss of chaos attempts to kill Sylver but is scared off by Scirf pretending to be an animal dying from the mange and falls over a cliff to his death. His priests attempting to shatter the squirrels into pieces with the herb are themselves turned into minuscule stoats by the same herb and Welkin is free of the evil of Torca Marda. The next day Lord Ragnar is killed in battle with the rats and Prince Poynt promises to elect Sylver to a lord if he defeats the rats thus fulfilling the mole coven s prophecy. Lord Haukin tells Sylver and the weasels to partially knock down the sea walls allowing a bore to flood to Castle Rayn and destroy the rat hordes along with the effigy although Lord Flaggatis escapes along with most of the rats.

" Cloud palace ",China
" A cloud palace or cloud castle was an abode of cloud giants kept floating on a single large cloud by magic. 1  2  ",China
" Contents ",China
" A cloud palace was like any other cloud giant castle only it was constructed upon a magical solid cloud. 1  In addition to the castle structure itself the island of cloud upon which it was built was said to contain giant sized gardens with luscious fruit trees. 3  ",China
" Cloud giants could not steer or control where a cloud palace went  they relied on the blowing of the wind and would dock their palace at various mountain peaks whenever they drifted to such points. 1  ",China
" The construction of a cloud palace was an especially complicated endeavor which was exhausting to all those involved. To begin it required at least twelve cloud giants working together and using their inherent control over clouds and fog to gather a massive cloud centered over a single runecaster. This waiting runecaster performed a ten hour ritual involving a rune inscribed pebble contained in a small leather pouch. If he or she was successful the mass of cloud solidified and the other runecasters forced the cloud into the sky again. 1  ",China
" After this the lead runecaster had to take the leather bag with the runestone and hide it somewhere in the middle of the cloud. Tampering with the sack or the pebble it contained could cause the cloud to crash. 1  ",China
" The rune required for the creation of a cloud palace was the most complicated rune ever discovered by any of the giants and took more than a year to properly inscribe. 1  ",China
" Only after the cloud was solidified could construction of the palace itself begin which was no different than the construction of any castle or palace on the ground. 1  ",China
" The first cloud palace on Toril was created by the giant god Stronmaus as a small duplicate of his own realm of Stormhold. The father of the cloud giants Nicias won this palace in a bet with Stronmaus but the palace eventually crashed somewhere in the region of Anauroch. 1  ",China
" Many years later runecasters were able to duplicate the magic that had kept the palace afloat. 1  ",China
" Early in the history of the Vast before human rule a flying cloud castle was defeated in some magical battle. It crashed in the area near the later site of Thindilar and tumbled across the ground steadily obliterated as it went causing ground tremors and leaving a trail of destruction. Debris bits of dead cloud giant and giant treasures were left scattered across the countryside. Dwarves looted much of the treasure reworking them into their own artworks. 2  ",China
" It was rare for cloud giants to live on cloud palaces  most lived atop high mountains. 3  A notable cloud palace was often docked at the storm giant aerie located atop an exceptionally tall mountain in the center of Lake Woe. 4  ",China
" Stronmaus himself inhabited a fantastic cloud palace which was moored to Annam All Father s steading at Gudheim. The palace contained a massive pool with healing properties. 5  ",China
" The Plain of Standing Stones the central region of Anauroch contained the ruins of a storm giant cloud palace called the Shattered Tower. 6  Whether this palace was the original cloud palace of Nicias was not known. 1  ",China
" Seemingly cloud palaces became more common by the late 15th century DR. The cloud giant countess Sansuri resided in a cloud palace named Lyn Armaal. 7  Likewise the wizard Zephyros lived in a floating tower. 8  ",China

" In the tropics we often have thunderstorms. They do not last very long perhaps for an hour  but they can cause havoc during that short time. ",China
" One evening at about 6 o clock I was sitting in front of my house just relaxing and doing nothing in particular. There were some white clouds blocking the blue sky. There was no hint of rain. It was just a pleasant warm evening which was very normal. ",China
" Then I heard a distant rumble of thunder. It was so faint that I thought I might have imagined it. Gradually the rumbling became more distinct. I looked towards the sky and still could not see any hint of rain. White clouds still dominate the sky. ",China
" The rumbling grew louder and louder. Very quickly the eastern sky turned black. The speed at which the black clouds appeared astonished me. In a few minutes I could feel cool wind blowing from the blackened sky. In another few minutes the whole sky was engulfed by black swirling clouds. The wind increased in intensity. I could see the trees bent precariously to one side as though they were going to fall over or get blown away like feathers. ",China
" Suddenly I heard a very loud roar above the rumbling of thunder and the howling of wind. The roar became louder and louder. It sounded like a gigantic train approaching though it certainly was not one. The sound was quite unsettling. I looked in the direction of the roar and saw a white curtain of approaching rain. ",China
" Next second it was upon us. The corrugated iron roof of my house rattled shakily as the pouring rain crashed down upon it. I ran into the house. The storm was in full swing. ",China
" Flashes of lightning lit up the darkened sky followed by cracks of thunder as though in reply. Some flashes of lightning came dangerously close to our house. The following cracks of thunder were immediate and deafening. I saw my father utter a silent prayer. My kid sister had her palms against her ears while safely enclosed in my mother s arms. ",China
" The fury of the storm was incredible. I looked out the window to see a white blur of rain that cut visibility to a few feet. The rain came down at a large angle driven on by the wind. The noise of rain on the roof was so loud that we could not even hear ourselves talk. All we could do was to stay in the house and wait for the storm to blow over. We also hoped that lightning would not strike us and the wind would not blow the roof away. ",China
" The storm raged for about an hour while we waited. Then as suddenly as it came the storm rained itself out. Clear blue skies appeared and soon the black clouds disappeared. The rain got less and stopped. The wind stopped blowing. ",China
" I stepped out onto the cool wet grass to breathe in the cool air. It was quite an exhilarating feeling to do this immediately after a thunderstorm. Everything felt so fresh and clean. It was as though the storm had just given the earth a thorough cleaning. Come to think of it it just might have done that. ",China
" After checking my house and finding no serious damage I took a walk around the neighborhood to see what damage the storm had done to the trees and other houses. I was sure I could see plenty of this. ",China

" So why not get out over the Bank Holiday weekend and bask in the glorious West Yorkshire countryside on a free family day out at one of the area s most scenic spots. ",China
" We ve pinpointed five spectacular places to walk picnic and take in the landscape. All are within half an hour of Huddersfield town centre and some can be easily reached using public transport. The walks take in woodland water and heritage trails. ",China
" 1 Honley Woods. ",China
" Try a 2.5 mile wander through this White Rose Forest  a partnership between five local authorities in West Yorkshire and public and voluntary organisations  one of the county s largest remaining ancient semi natural woodland areas. Park in Honley which is a 15 minute walk away and enter the woods at Hassocks Lane  or off Knowle Lane if approaching from Meltham Road  and follow the circular path around meadows and ponds through woodland and open ground. There are prehistoric archaeological features   cairns earthworks and burial sites   concealed in the undergrowth. ",China
" 2 Digley Reservoir. ",China
" The Yorkshire Water reservoir to the south west of Holmfirth is one of six in the region open to walkers and offers a 4.9 mile route along lanes fields and across open moorland. It can be accessed from the Digley Quarry car park to the north. This walk is rated as unsuitable for very young children and the infirm but offers peace and tranquility and plenty of places to put out a picnic mat. It s a good one for blowing the cobwebs away. YWA has just installed two new dog waste bins so that owners can keep the site clean for all walkers. ",China
" 3 Emley Circular Trail. ",China
" This 6 mile trail around the fringes of Emley takes in both countryside and heritage sites including mining relics and an old packhorse bridge. It starts at the post office in the village centre where there is a small car park and takes in the sort of rolling countryside that would please a hobbit. For a detailed route description and historic details of what to see visit kirklees.gov.uk leisure. No need to take a picnic as Denby Dale has plenty of pubs and cafes to feed the weary traveller. ",China
" 4 The Pen Den Trail. ",China

It takes in part of the Trans Pennine Trail and is clearly signposted. Directions start at Penistone and take walkers to Thurlstone Ingbirchworth and Upper Denby before reaching Denby Dale. There are paths bridleways and stiles to navigate and stout shoes are recommended so it s not one for very young children. Once again kirklees.gov.uk leisure has a detailed guide. ",China

" An easy flat walk of just over one mile suitable for all ages and with easy access for buggies and wheelchairs. Yorkshire Water advises parking on the roadside at Reservoir Road. The reservoir is between Meltham and Slaithwaite and affords wonderful views over the Colne Valley. There are open moors on one side and woodland on the other with picnic benches on site. ",China

" In Which I Storm a Castle ",China
" In the town of Svetvincenat  St. Vincent  a history buff finds fresh fodder for a ripe imagination. The lovely town square is bordered by its Renaissance church Venetian bell tower and administrative loggia all dating from the 16th century. A tiny chapel built in the 14th century is decorated with valuable frescoes. The town well dominates the central area of the square. It is first mentioned in ancient texts from 965 AD so its roots evidently reach deep into history itself. The town is situated in the midst of pastoral greenery   olive groves vineyards small farms and livestock producers live in the surrounding countryside. Approximately 100 varieties of mushrooms also make Svetvincenat their home. The piece de resistance is the 15th century castle which dominates one side of the square. It boasts several towers   two round one square. Formerly luxurious living quarters overlook the square in regal austerity. The castle door used to be approached over a drawbridge   in modern times one walks over a much less romantic dry ground approach. Intrigued we walked around the entire castle s perimeter. Wherever there were tiny apertures I peered longingly at the interior. Several times I expressed my wish to enter and was feeling rather dejected that the gates were shutting me out. I wanted to explore this fascinating edifice  This castle was the center of a politically intriguing and varied history. Changing hands often between the various powers that be it played an important role over the years. The stories it could tell include Templar Knights monks and ancient abbeys. It may even have been silent witness to the torture and stake death of a young woman accused of witchcraft  Built earlier there is an inscription over the door labeling 1485 as its  official  origin. It is named after the Grimani family 2 sons of which married the daughters of the previous lord who had died without male heirs  the Grimani boys are credited with reconstructing its walls after the castle was damaged in the 1500s. When we had walked its full extent my brother in law was amazed to note that the gates were now open  We wandered inside and saw a crew busy at work on a major restoration project. Not knowing whether we were allowed in or not we stormed the gates boldly and entered without a shot being fired  The crew kept to their tasks apparently unalarmed at the Canadian invasion. It was easy to imagine the servants scurrying about within those massive walls and visualize stiff ballgowns cannon fire and political intrigue in secret passageways  In close proximity to the past I found myself once again thinking of the variety of human dramas that those ancient stones have participated in over the centuries. Not wanting to disrupt the crew s labors we took a cursory look at the work in progress and at the views within the walls. We slipped furtively to our car unnoticed our mission accomplished. I melted into the evening shadows reflecting that it is a lot easier  and a lot more fun  to storm a castle than I had imagined  ",China

" Like other reviewers the first thing you notice after a short walk from admissions is the well kept luscious and very very green   go figure   grounds which surround the castle. The landscaping is gorgeous and spacious with a number of trails and paths upon which to wander and take a leisurely stroll. A more quiet and less crowded alternative to entering the castle   and lengthy line ups   as you make your way to the top. You have to be in pretty good shape to make the ascent as the stairways can be steep and narrow. Unfortunately the way to the top is off limits to most who may have a physical disability but once you get there the view of the country side makes the trip worthwhile. Yes there is a stone and many stand in line to get a snap shot as one lays down and tilts his or her head backwards and out over the ledge   for a smooch with a damp wet stone. Personally I skipped the kiss   preferring instead to watch others partake. Of course staff are on hand to ensure one s safety and to take pics for a reasonable fee   although I can t remember the exact amount. All  n all it was a fun and somewhat relaxing way to spend a few hours and grab some trinkets from the tourist shop. And like I said the setting offers just as much as the old stone landmark...the castle a kiss and the countryside  ",China

" Situated near Cork the castle was a 40 minute drive from our base in Limerick. It cost 13 euros to enter. Lovely gardens to walk around and the attraction of the tradition of kissing the Blarney Stone. Be prepared for a long wait if you choose to kiss the stone it would be daft to be there and not kiss it. The queue we were in started at the bottom of the stairs in the castle. It took us an hour to reach very top where the stone is housed. Please note that the stairs get steeper as you get nearer the top and it is very narrow. Therefore it is not suitable for anyone who is infirm or can t stand for a long period of time ",China

" The Blarney Castle isn t just a building with a stone to kiss. It s a campus of attractions like Gardens and historical relics. I wish we could have stayed longer but they do close at the end of the day. When you visit be sure to pay attention to details  every building has something significant to read and the gardens hold secrets you never knew existed. The kissing of the stone is paramount. It s a windy steep staircase to the platform that can render you claustrophobic  except it s not a long trip up the stairs . The guys holding you are very professional they ll take your picture and allow you to snap a picture yourself  Overall this is another typical tourist spot but well worth it. ",China

Their is a great poison garden near the castle with placards explaining the plants used over the years for a variety of maladies. It takes about 90 minutes from the bottom of the stairs to get to the Stone so patience is a must. Be sure to go to the Woolen Mills while here too as you ll find some great shopping opportunities.

" On the development of Storm King s Thunder Chris Perkins Lead Designer of the book 3  said in the case of the Giant s story for 5th edition we found an ancient lore from an old book called Giant Craft. This idea of an Ordning it s sort of like the structure of Giant society. In the Storm King s Thunder the basic story is well what happens if that Ordning is shattered  The Giants basically have to go out into the world and earn the respect and favor of their Gods to create a whole new Ordning and what that does to the small folk of the world when the Giants are stomping around doing all kinds of bad stuff. 6  ",China

" Alex Springer for SLUG Magazine wrote where most campaigns tend to begin in some kind of neutral relatively safe location Storm King s Thunder thrusts our intrepid adventurers into a recently sieged village that is being picked apart by goblins.  ...  Allowing the players to shift gears and take the role of a relatively normal person in the middle of a city wide attack lets players experience the fantastic world of Dungeons   Dragons from the eyes of a civilian. In a game that expects its players to become superheroes it was a nice dose of reality to see what it s like to face a supernatural being without the benefit of supernatural powers. As we continued through the campaign I was impressed at how well Storm King s Thunder balanced structure with improvisational freedom.  ...  We re not talking about generic go fetch  missions or cleansing ruin after ruin of its monstrous occupants either one chance encounter finds the players manipulating a lovesick hill giant into betraying her husband stealing queen. Based on my experience running Storm King s Thunder as a novice DM I continue to be impressed with the quality of work that Wizards of the Coast puts into their roleplaying game peripherals. The art is fantastic the maps are meticulous and all of it is set against a Shakespearean story of corruption betrayal and power. 14  ",China
" Cameron Kunzelman for Paste wrote reading through Storm King s Thunder for the first time gave me the strongest itch that I have ever had to actually put a party through a pre created adventure. The adventure is created in such a way that any given location contains a dozen plot hooks interesting characters and beautiful descriptions that would be suitable for an entire campaign.  ...  It s hard to be specific here without stealing some of the wonder but let me tell you about some of the things I found to be the most wonderful in Storm King s Thunder. There s a 40000  year old kraken wizard who hangs out in the ocean using its telekinetic powers to lure people into its service from hundreds of miles away. There s a fire giant who wants to reassemble a magical Voltron to punch dragons in the mouth with.  ...  Of course there are parts I don t enjoy as much. Storm King s Thunder is very equitable when it comes to gender with many giant lords being women and the gender assignment of many NPCs being up to DM discretion. However that macro plot I mentioned before starts off with a old fashioned fridging of King Hekton s wife Queen Neri and it s such a conspicuous trope y stumble that I initially assumed that it was meant to be commentary of some kind  as far as I can tell though it s just a plot point . 15  ",China
" Cecilia D Anastasio for Kotaku in a review comparing Out of the Abyss and Storm King s Thunder wrote after a few pages of lore and history about the giants of the Forgotten Realms Chapter One starts players in a deserted settlement infested with goblins.  ...  The only real hook into Storm King s Thunder s opening moments is the bell ringing from the bell tower where goblins are gleefully swinging on a rope. There it was  the easy opening. Go to the bell tower. Explore the town.  ...  Players got a strong sense of each others  characters by exploring the empty settlement. It s just a start but the simplicity of Storm King s Thunder s first chapter made it fun. The experience of it wasn t prescribed and players weren t made servile by ten NPCs four hanging towers and thirteen fungi. Later on when shit gets real in the Savage Frontier I welcome the new Dungeons   Dragons adventure to throw what it s got at us. The first chapter isn t the time for that. The lack of content in the intro to Storm King s Thunder for some was also paralyzing.  ...  But I d rather players meet the challenge of creativity than suffocate in the embrace of a too meaty adventure. At least we re picking up the game again. 16  ",China
" James Haeck for Geek   Sundry wrote before we can see why Roll20 does Storm King s Thunder so well let s talk about the adventure itself. Storm King s Thunder is technically a sequel to 5e s first story arc Tyranny of Dragons in the way that Captain America  Civil War is a sequel to Age of Ultron. You don t need to have played or even read Tyranny to get  this adventure but you ll enjoy some easter eggs. This adventure is also shorter than the others.  ...  I still prefer the tactile sensation of flipping pages  ...  but Roll20 s GM tools are startlingly useful. I love showing my players images from the adventure for instance. All of the illustrations that you d find in the book are loaded into Roll20 s image database and it s much easier to just click a share with everyone  button than to awkwardly turn the hardcover around try  and fail  to cover the spoilery text and probably break the book s binding in the process. The interactive Table of Contents makes flipping through Roll20 s format infinitely easier than leafing through a print book. It s even easier than using a PDF with a hyperlinked Table of Contents since you can always pop it open from the right hand sidebar without closing your other open windows. A small negative  the adventure frequently mentions Player s Handbook or Dungeon Master s Guide not by page number but by chapter number. And since they can t hyperlink to those books it s a small grievance but one with cascading effects. 17  ",China

" Storm King s Thunder Review ",China
" After its limited release a few weeks ago Storm King s Thunder is now finally available in stores everywhere. The physical book is a hardcover with 256 pages on glossy paper. Like all previous Wizards adventures it has plenty of great art and full color maps. There are no fold outs or additional accessories included or necessary to play. ",China
" The story here is set in the Forgotten realms and is one of classic heroic fantasy. Storm King s Thunder pits the players against the rampaging giant lords of the northern regions of the Sword Coast and as such has a distinctly Nordic flavor. Throughout the adventure the players will explore vast untamed wildlands complete with frozen oceans snow caped mountains dense forests and ancient ruins. They will harness the ancient power of rune magic encounter wild barbarians battle giants and take to the high seas in search of a way to stop a dangerous upheaval from destroying all that the  small folk  hold dear. It stands out as one of the strongest published adventures for 5th edition to date making both artistic and technical improvements upon its predecessors. The following review will have its spoilers marked below. ",China
"   GENERAL POINTS   ",China
" There are a few major reasons why Storm King s Thunder stands out from the rest of the Wizards library and they all have to do with how content is presented. I have never encountered an official adventure that didn t have tons of good ideas in it but never before have those ideas been so clearly and cleanly articulated. ",China
" ORGANIZATIONAL SUPERIORITY ",China
" Right off that bat it s clear that this is the most well organized 5th edition adventure Wizards has ever made. Information is laid out in a way that makes each scenario very easy to navigate making specifics easy to find at a moments notice. ",China
" For instance chapter three contains a massive list of every relevant location in the book presented in alphabetical order. This makes navigating all of the smaller settlements and map features a breeze allowing the DM to go straight to any specific detail needed for overland travel. ",China
" Each dungeon also has a Roster section detailing every single monster s location and what they do under certain conditions. This is the sort of thing that DMs would normally have to create for themselves in their own personal notes. This time however all the work is done for us and is presented in a simple and elegant manner. ",China
" The scenarios do away with overly complicated  if then  situations which require the DM to search all over the place trying to find relevant information. Even if there are  if then  situations they are usually written out all on the same page rather than telling you to flip over to this page or that. Out of the Abyss had this problem at times. Gracklstugh for instance happened to be my favorite chapter of that adventure but holy cow was it ever convoluted  I had to create my own visual flowchart just to keep all of the branching plot lines in order. It was a big mess of amazing ideas that were unfortunately very sloppily delivered. The scenarios in Storm King s Thunder however are very straightforward and organized in a fairly linear fashion. This doesn t mean the adventures are linear however as I will touch on more in the sections below. ",China
" As minor flourishes the introduction even includes a graphical flowchart for the plot and a  dramatis personae  for the characters. The flowchart is a nice visual representation of how the adventure is to be run at a glance and the dramatis personae makes is easy to look up any major character  and there are quite a few  quickly in alphabetical order. These are both the sorts of things that you would expect the community to generate out of necessity. Seeing this in the actual book makes me think that Wizards was more in touch this time around about what DMs want and how they can make running the adventure easier. ",China
" SANDBOX GAMEPLAY ",China
" Another thing that Storm King s Thunder does better than any other official 5th edition module is create a physical sandbox with its locations. Chapter three is largely responsible for this effect which I will go into detail about in the sections below. Suffice it to say that players have never had more freedom to go in whichever direction they want and be guaranteed to find something awesome without fear of ruining the story. No matter where they go on the map and no matter how they choose to get there there is always something interesting waiting there for them. ",China
" Locations on the map largely exist independently from the adventure s main plot and there is no pre established order that the players need to explore them in. This is what makes the world so believable. Its more than just a series of areas that all exist solely to further the immediate plot of the story. Even the locations and events that do tie into the plot can be  with a few major exceptions  encountered in almost any order. On top of that there are a ton of purely optional side quests that can enhance the main story line should the players be interested. This gives them more agency than ever before. ",China
" Other adventures try to act like sandboxes Out of the Abyss and Curse of Strahd for example  but they ultimately fail because if certain locations are skipped or encountered out of order the story becomes less effective or even ruined at certain points. When you play these adventures it s usually pretty clear that there is an intended order in which locations should be explored for the story to be at its best. Yes you could go out of order but it just makes the game awkward. Take Out of the Abyss for example  if your players choose to skip Sloobludop and go in another direction they will be missing out on a HUGE plot point the rise of Demogorgon. He s only the main villain of the entire campaign so  no big deal  Take Curse of Strahd as a second example  The game is clearly laid out so that the characters travel along a path that moves from east to west across the map and blocks them from moving south using mountains. Its not a sandbox. These adventures try to tell the players that they can go wherever they want while simultaneously making it clear to the DM that they should be steered towards specific locations. That or the terrain just funnels them into a linear path. ",China
" Storm King s Thunder doesn t have this problem because it effectively creates a living breathing world that exists independently of the main plot. It also doesn t prod the DM to artificially steer players here or there while simultaneously telling them that they are free to go where they like. When they are told they have a choice they actually have a choice and they don t have to worry that if they make the wrong choice they will screw up the story. Storm King s Thunder may have a fairly linear plot but its map is as close to a sandbox as we ve seen so far. Once the players realize this they might just get lost exploring all of these incredible places and side quests. ",China
" THE DEFINITIVE SWORD COAST ADVENTURE ",China
" I think its safe to say that I view this as being the best  Sword Coast adventure  we ve gotten for 5th edition so far. As I touched on earlier it brings the setting alive in ways that adventures like Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Princes of the Apocalypse just aren t capable of. Hoard of the Dragon Queen for example feels like you are riding through its setting with blinders on unable to explore and experience too much beyond what exists solely to support the main plot. The difference between now and then is staggering. ",China
" There is so much sheer content in this book that a single playthrough would barely scratch the surface. You could run a whole campaign based on chapter three alone. It presents a ton of great ideas which can naturally lead the players from one area to the other without feeling disjointed or restrictive. Each region presented here has all sorts of little locations and encounters that give glimpses of what local life is like and how that region is different from the rest. This is what makes it all more believable this time around. In fact using random encounters at all seems a bit lame when you ve got a whole map full of handcrafted locations NPCs and encounters to use instead. Storm King s Thunder doesn t encompass the entire Sword Coast but the areas it does depict are presented beautifully. ",China
" A FEW FLAWS ",China
" Despite its many virtues and improvements Storm King s Thunder does still have a few flaws. Let me preface this by saying that I don t think any of these are particularly damning or serious. That said here they are  ",China
" Sadly as is the case with most sandboxes much of the content in the book will never be explored or used in any single play through. The book is the exact same length as Out of the Abyss for example but since Storm King s Thunder has tons of detailed content that will most likely never be seen by the players it clocks in for less play time. You could even argue that this literally means you get less playtime for your money. You could also argue that yes players who love free form exploring and side quests can eventually get around to seeing most of its content anyways but it feels much less likely in an adventure like this. This will probably be a shorter play through for most groups. ",China
" The book does have a fair amount of typos in it which is a bit surprising seeing as how incredibly well organized it is content wise. It s not pervasive and it is of course completely superficial and will not affect your ability to run the game. It s just noticeable. ",China
" The whole harness the power of rune magic  and defeat giants by becoming giant  ideas are in practice pretty mediocre. I m not implying that we were mislead in any way. I was just expecting a bit more I guess. For instance rune magic only exists from a gameplay standpoint within magic items in the back of the book and in scripted events during the adventure. There aren t any additional options for players like what was shown in the Prestige Classes and Rune Magic  Unearthed Arcana Wizards released last October. ",China
" As for the becoming giant  element of the game I won t spoil it here  you can read about it in the spoiler laden sections below . For now I will just say that it feels very tacked on like an afterthought. Early on when Storm King s Thunder was announced it seems like it was implied that this idea was going to throw a very unique twist into a significant portion of the game. In reality its just a fun little gimmick that shows up only once. ",China
"   THE ADVENTURES   ",China
" Here is a brief summary and my commentary on the specific adventures in Storm King s Thunder. MAJOR SPOILERS are below but if you are a DM wanting to know exactly what you and your players will be doing in this campaign this section is for you. ",China
"    MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW    ",China
" Chapter 1  A Great Upheaval ",China
" The adventure begins with the players travelling to Nightstone a small rural village that has just played victim to a cloud giant attack. As they explore the wreckage they encounter looting goblins destroyed buildings surviving guards and Zhentarim operatives. Just when things seem to be getting in order a fleeing party of murderous orcs tries to take refuge within the village walls prompting a possible showdown between the players the Zhentarim the pursuing elves and the fleeing orcs. Later the players track down and rescue other surviving villagers in a nearby cave where they are held prisoner by goblins and ogres. ",China
" The chapter concludes with the players following up on one of three quests they receive from the villagers. A friendly cloud giant named Zephyros offers to transport them in his flying castle to their destination. Along the way the players have a run in with the Lord s Alliance  mistaking Zephyros for a threat  and evil elemental air cultists. ",China
" All in all its quite an exciting first chapter. There are so many different characters and groups represented all with different agendas. The players have tons of opportunities to engage in combat as well as roleplaying. There are multiple times when the players must choose who s side they are on or try to pit different groups against one another in order to survive. Its complicated but in a fun and well presented way. ",China
" Chapter 2  Rumblings ",China
" Here the players are led to one of three different settlements  A frigid town called Bryn Shander in Icewind Dale a lush temple farm called Goldenfields near the Dessarin Valley or a bustling mercantile town called Triboar. Once they arrive and get situated the location comes under attack by giants and the players must defend the settlement with the help of a handful of NPCs. After the battle is concluded the surviving NPCs give the players quests which help drive the story forward. ",China
" Many of the NPCs here are quite interesting and the scenario does a good job of making the players actually care about them. This is due in large part to the fact that the players must control two characters at once during the attack. Some may find this daunting but I think most groups will quickly adapt. ",China
" That said I do think that this is the weakest chapter in the book  though that isn t saying much . The three towns frankly struck me as being a bit mundane. It felt like a chore to read through all of the descriptions about each town s blacksmiths inns temples etc. Especially since many of these elements are extremely similar between them or if they are different they are mundane enough as to not be of to much interest. Playing these scenarios will of course be quite different since there will be plenty of combat excitement and interesting NPCs. However compared to some of the inspired scenarios presented later in the book these settlements come off as a bit redundant and mundane. ",China
" Add to this the fact that only one third of the text here will actually be used in the game and it all left me wondering if this chapter was really worth all the space it takes up in the book. I do acknowledge that it is a necessary chapter and that it can be fun I just think it could have been more concise and less over bloated. Its not bad its just that the whole rest of the book is better. ",China
" Chapter 3  The Savage Frontier ",China
" From the mundane to the absolutely sublime we step out of Chapter 2 and enter Chapter 3. This is by far the best chapter in the book. Its main contribution is a massive list of over 160 locations spread across the northern region of the Sword Coast complete with maps random encounters NPCs and treasure. There are dozens and dozens of gems to be found here. ",China
" The scope and degree to which this brings the Sword Coast alive is truly inspiring and in the sections above I touch on how this chapter creates the best 5th edition sandbox I ve ever seen. Even the least interesting locations always have something noteworthy in them and the most interesting locations are good enough to inspire entire campaigns centered just around the NPCs and suggested encounters presented. ",China
" Much of the reason why this chapter is so successful is because each entry is quick and to the point unlike chapter 2  giving you just enough information to get you started and let the DM pick up the creative reigns. I honestly think that the importance of this chapter is actually bigger than the adventure it is written for. ",China
" Chapter 4  The Chosen Path ",China
" Here the players meet a friendly frost giant named Harshnag who leads them to consult with a divine oracle at an ancient temple. Deep within the frozen mountains of the north the oracle explains how the players can combat the giant threat and gives them a quest to scour all corners of the map looking for ancient artifacts. For each artifact they find they gain the option to challenge a corresponding giant lord and steal its conch of teleportation to gain access to Maelstrom the stronghold of the storm giants and King Hekaton s court. A plot twist also occurs here in the arrival of a shapeshifting ancient blue dragon who has infiltrated the storm giant s court. In a daring escape the players are offered aid from a mysterious band of dragon cultists in an airship. ",China
" Whew  This chapter has a lot going on in it. Besides providing a great and inspiring set piece for the campaign it also delves deep into the lore of giants and their mythical idols. Rune magic is touched on here and it has some cool traps and roleplaying opportunities with the oracle Harshnag and the dragon cultists. It is a strong chapter overall but it has a few issues  ",China
" As I foreshadowed above I do think it is unfortunate that the players need only confront one giant lord to progress to chapter 10. That means that since only ONE out of the next FIVE chapters will be of use in your campaign about 50 pages worth of content in the book is entirely wasted. It is true that in theory they can confront the other giant lords at some other point if they wish. But let s be real. It seems unlikely that players will want to keep fighting giant lords once they get the opportunity to continue towards Maelstrom which is a much more urgent and exciting place to take the story. If they had restructured the adventure to somehow require the players to confront multiple giant lords I think they could have stretched the campaign out to level 14 or 15. ",China
" Some other minor quibbles are as follows  The chapter commits the cardinal sin of possibly giving the players a quest that cannot be completed without the use of another adventure book. I get that it s optional and that it is fun to sometimes find references to other adventures here and there. Nonetheless it s kind of annoying to be given an exciting idea then immediately told that you can t do it unless you pay another  29.95. Another thing that sticks out here is that the map seems to have been colored incorrectly. A minor problem to be sure but it did throw me off since the location is described as being dark cold and covered in frost yet the map is drawn with a very bright and warm color scheme as if the floor were made of clean sandstone. No darkness or frost in sight. Even the painting of the oracle room contradicts the map s depiction. No other map in the adventure had this problem for me. ",China
" Chapter 5  Den of the Hill Giants ",China
" The first of the five giant lords that hold the key to Maelstrom is Ghum a brutish and loathsome hill giant holed up on a pig farm. The scenario seems to lend itself well to a stealthy approach with tactical isolated battles. ",China
" Overall this chapter is a good one but the setting might be a bit underwhelming when compared to the other superior choices out there. For instance after reading about Duke Zalto s massive subterranean forge and his plans to engage in an apocalyptic war with dragons using the power of an ancient primordial  the idea of fighting hill giants on a pig farm is just kind of  meh. That aside it s a competently written scenario with plenty of tactical combat and stealth opportunities  not so much roleplay . If your players like combat and aren t interested in politics then this is for you. ",China
" Chapter 6  Canyon of the Stone Giants ",China
" Here the players infiltrate a lair of stone giants called Deadstone Cleft. There are some interesting terrain features here and a couple of other creatures and NPCs to contend with such as a band of Uthgardt barbarians and a roc that roosts just outside the canyon. ",China
" Now this is more like it  The imagery here is strong and the stone giants themselves are much more interesting and mysterious than their hill giant brethren. Some stone giants are neutral preferring to live a life of artful mediation and stillness rather than crushing puny small folk. This presents some awesome roleplaying opportunities for a creative DM to play with. The barbarians also add another level of complexity and danger to the encounter. ",China
" Chapter 7  Berg of the Frost Giants ",China
" Travelling near the frigid waters of the Sea of Moving Ice the players infiltrate the frost giant fortress of Svardborg. Just getting to the fortress is a challenge in itself and one that presents many options  Sail by boat  Fly by airship  Fly by griffon  Fly by dragon  Once there the players have to contend with a wide variety of creatures and characters including winter wolves manticores dragons harpies a treacherous mage and the frost giants themselves. All of this is made more complicated by the fact that the area is surrounded by frigid water and any craft they use to approach is at risk of being spotted. ",China
" This is my favorite of the five chapters in this series because it is clearly and concisely laid out but also gives a very large set of toys and options to play with.  Frost giants are also my favorite giant so I may be a little biased  One of its highlights is that it plays up the ancient rivalry between dragons and giants allowing smart players to play both sides against one another. Its aquatic elements as well as its potential for some ship boarding action add to the fun. The showdown between the players and Jarl Storvald can go many ways and will reward players for being intelligent and resourceful. ",China
" Chapter 8  Forge of the Fire Giants ",China
" This scenario sees the players infiltrate Duke Zalto s enormous subterranean forge complex. Before they can set foot inside however the players must outwit the deceptive and murderous Yakfolk who control the village above Zalto s lair. As the players descend deeper into the forge they have the opportunity to free slaves that keep the complex running and enlist their help. Eventually they face off against Duke Zalto and his hell hounds thwarting his plans to reignite his mighty forge and reassemble the Vonindod an enormous collosus with which he seeks to wage war against all of dragonkind. A party of drow make a special appearance here as well throwing a curve ball into an already deadly situation. ",China
" This is the largest and most complex of the five chapters in this series. It is also quite dark and mature in comparison to the others. It has an almost concentration camp type feel what with slaves being beaten and worked to death throughout the whole area. It all may be a bit depressing for some. ",China
" Now that aside it is another very well crafted scenario and there are plenty of opportunities for smart players to use roleplaying to their advantage here. It is however a more challenging scenario to run from a DM s perspective with a lot of moving parts and interconnected factors at play. In the hands of a skilled DM this can be perhaps the most intricate and tactical scenario in the whole book but it takes a sizable amount of prep time. ",China
" Chapter 9  Castle of the Cloud Giants ",China
" The final chapter in this series involves the players infiltrating Countess Sansuri s flying castle. The Countess is vain but sociable lending this chapter quite well to social roleplaying. Players might fly aboard and ask for a peaceful audience with her then at the opportune moment strike at her vulnerabilities. Hazards include Sansuri s simulacra aarakocra cloud giants griffons air elementals invisible stalkers and even animated chess pieces  The characters also have the opportunity to seize the castle for themselves if they defeat all of its inhabitants. ",China
" This is my second favorite chapter in this series. Its easier to run than the fire giant scenario it has more interesting NPCs than the hill and stone giant scenarios and it plays with the giants vs dragons theme again which can be exploited by the players to give them an advantage. I like the whimsical arcana  feel to the whole thing. Its sort of like a castle from Alice in Wonderland. If your group has a lot of magic users consider steering them towards this chapter. There plenty of magic items scrolls and spells to be found here. ",China
" Chapter 10  Hold of the Storm Giants ",China
" After defeating one or more giant lords the players arrive at the underwater court of the Storm King himself. Maelstrom represents the most challenging piece of social roleplaying in the whole adventure. Surrounded by flooded chambers dangerous sea creatures and powerful storm giants the players must convince princess Serissa to trust them about her missing father King Hekaton. This is made difficult by the fact that those closest to her including her advisor Iymrith and her two sisters are evil and full of deceit. The players will have to be socially clever and resourceful to avoid getting into big trouble here. ",China
" This is another very strong chapter with interesting political drama and an awesome setting. It is quite possible  but unlikely  to complete this with very little combat which may be a disappointment for some. It challenges the players to remember what specific information they have learned previously about the NPCs and their various motives. Players armed with a good memory and a sensitivity to the social clues you drop as the DM will have an advantage. The underwater theme is also quite fun and there are a few nice touches included for the sake of immersion such as the anemone chests giant clams and crystal windows. Even without combat the setting itself can be deadly if not handled correctly. ",China
" I do wish that there were a few more opportunities throughout the campaign to learn about the situation at Maelstrom before travelling there. As it is the only sizable source of information about it is the Oracle at Annan s Temple who is basically just a talking head that info dumps the necessary information on the characters. I feel there is a real risk of the players getting to Hekaton s court and being a bit lost about what to say. ",China
" Chapter 11  Caught in the Tentacles ",China
" This chapter is jam packed with dramatic plot points. After gaining Serissa s trust she tasks the players with helping track down her father. The players will have to wander a bit investigating clues and leads which can be handled as specifically or as vaguely as the DM likes. They end up infiltrating a waterborne gambling ring run by an operative from the Kraken Society. Under interrogation he tells the players that Hekaton has been sequestered aboard a ship that sails in the Trackless Sea to avoid detection. The players use one of many methods available to reach the ship and fight their way on board. Once Hekaton is freed they might return back to Maelstrom or experience an epic showdown with a mighty kraken. ",China
" This chapter provides a welcome change of pace to the dungeon crawl room to room style found in the previous six chapters. The adventures here are also shorter and more varied with a fair amount of travelling. This gives the players the opportunity to gain another level or two in their travels before the finale against the dragon. I like that this chapter rewards the players for establishing contacts and resources throughout the game. For instance depending on how much wealth and or friends the players have amassed sea travel can be done in a variety of ways including by boat airship dragon or even flying castle  This chapter feels much more cinematic and free form than its predecessors even allowing the possibility for King Hekaton to die. ",China
" Chapter 12  Doom in the Desert ",China
" Once Hekaton is back in Maelstrom or news of his death has reached there it becomes clear that Iymrith the ancient blue dragon that infiltrated his court must answer for her treachery. An alliance between storm giants and the small folk is forged and the two march upon the dragon s lair. The players are also each given a potion of giant size to make things more interesting. The bulk of this chapter is a battle royal staged in a huge abandoned amphitheater between the storm giants players and the dragon. This obviously has the potential to be deadly for a number of players and NPCs so they will have to work together and use tactics to survive. Iymrith has a host of gargoyles at her command and the players will also potentially have to deal with yuan ti air elementals and even a mummy lord  Iymrith also fights on her home turf and thus has access to her lair actions and a few traps and defense mechanisms to keep the battle interesting. ",China
" This is the shortest chapter in the book which is appropriate being that it s basically just a giant battle no pun intended . It s a fun and satisfying action movie type blowout designed to end the story with a bang. Teaming up with the storm giants also gives the players another opportunity to control NPCs in combat. Again that may be daunting for some but for others controlling a storm giant will be a welcome end of campaign reward. And hey all good campaigns have to end with the party slaying a dragon right  Classic  ",China
" Appendices  A   D ",China
" The appendices contain a few necessary add ons to support the main campaign. Appendix A  Linked Adventures is a guide on how to connect other Wizards adventures with Storm King s Thunder. Crossovers are particularly strong with Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Princes of the Apocalypse. Appendix B  Magic Items is exactly that  magic items. It includes a number of rune magic items made specifically for this adventure. It is a bit disappointing that they don t have an item for every single rune but the ones that are there are at least mildly interesting. Appendix C  Creatures includes all the necessary stat blocks including ones for Maegera the Dawn Titan uthgardt shamans tressyms and yakfolk. Most interestingly though it also includes some expanded options for giants giving them some new powers and actions to keep them fresh and cut down on repetition. After all you will be facing a lot of giants in this adventure. Appendix D  Special NPCs contains stats for the NPCs you will be handing out to the players during special scenarios. Each stat block includes a nifty little Roleplaying Information section and full color portrait making it easier for them to bond with these characters and create unique behaviors for them. ",China
"    END OF SPOILERS    ",China
" Is Storm King s Thunder the best 5th edition adventure Wizards has ever done  Well I can tell you that from an organizational and technical standpoint it certainly is. It successfully improves upon the mistakes of its predecessors and delivers the best version of the Sword Coast yet. I think it s safe to say that it s better than Tyranny of Dragons and Princes of the Apocalypse. Out of the Abyss and Curse of Strahd are harder to compare because they attempt to achieve very different things and offer different styles of play. That aside I do think you could easily make a compelling argument for Storm King s Thunder taking the top spot solely on its organizational merits its level of ease for the DM and its truly sandbox type gameplay. Rest assured that if you choose to dive into this world you ll get to experience one of the finest adventures on the market for 5th edition today. ",China

" Thunder and lightning ",China
" Thunder and lightning is a potential hazard which should be taken seriously when walking outdoors. It s wise to familiarise yourself with what to do if you encounter a thunderstorm. ",China
" Direct lightning strikes are rare. Partial strikes are more common either through induction from a nearby object or from the ground. Reducing surface contact with the ground or object will reduce the power of the strike. ",China
" Here are some safety tips to reduce the risks  ",China
" Plan ahead. Always check the weather forecast before starting a walk. We recommend checking the Met Office and Mountain Weather Information Service. If storms are forecast consider cancelling the walk or altering the route to one at a lower elevation or on less exposed ground. Be especially cautious after a prolonged period of high humidity. ",China
" Monitor the weather. Weather forecasts are mainly accurate but they can t always predict the exact time and location of storms. Keep an eye on the build up of clouds   if they start to become menacing it s time to review your plans. On warm days the danger will increase during the day as the heat builds. ",China
" Be aware. As a storm approaches its distance can be estimated by measuring the time between lightning flashes and the rumble of thunder. Lighting appears almost simultaneously while thunder travels at 1 km per 3 seconds. So a three second delay between lightning and thunder means that the storm is about 1 km away  a six second delay means that the storm is about 2 km away. ",China
" Lose height first. If you get caught by an approaching storm try to put higher ground between you and the storm. Lightning strikes are more frequent on summits and other projections because lightning takes the shortest route to earth. The higher and more exposed you are the greater the danger. Only descend if it s safe to do so  scrambling quickly on uneven terrain can be particularly hazardous in rainfall. ",China
" Find a safe place. It s safest to find the lowest open ground rather than taking shelter in caves or under trees   these will put you at risk if struck by lightning as the lightning takes the quickest route to the ground. Ideally crouch or sit on the ground and aim to ensure that there is higher ground above you. ",China
" Minimise contact with the ground and any conducting objects. Ideally crouch or sit upright on top of insulating material such as rucksacks or sleeping mats with hands on knees rather than touching the ground. Although they don t significantly increase the risk of attracting a strike it s wise to lay metal items aside until the storm passes e.g. tools or walking poles. Avoid metal fences. If in a group try to space out slightly. ",China
" Help others. It is safe to touch someone who has been struck by lightning and provide them with CPR and First Aid. Anyone struck by lightning should always seek medical advice. ",China
" Lightning strikes a random target dealing  200  560   DMG and inflicting Coma to all nearby enemies for  1.5 1.8  secs. ",China
" The Thunder God  TG  is a Legendary Hero that uses melee attacks. His Skill Thunderstorm strikes a random target  will hit any enemies in the blast radius  dealing damage and inflicting Coma to all nearby enemies for 1.5 seconds. In Raids Dungeons and Here Be Monsters most players find the Thunder God to be a valuable asset to their army due to his high damaging area of effect  AOE  procs. ",China
" Thunderstorm will continue to hit the same target until that target has been destroyed. In battles Thunderstorm will usually target the Town Hall if Thunder God is near. If he s far from the Town Hall Thunderstorm will target Heroes and Army Camps. ",China

He received the new Japanese Ambassador Ryuji Takeuzhi. Eilat In the Middle East are emerging more crises. The State of Israel which wants to transform the port of Eilat at the vertex of the Gulf of Aqaba into a naval base is again facing a difficult problem provided. Saudi Arabia considered waters of the Gulf and wants to block the passage of Israeli ships at gunpoint. The Saudi Arab opposition was carried out a few days after the first American oil tanker for Israel had broken through the 7j hrige barrier. The old motive for war Israel would again conjured up a second blockade. Geneva the peaceful image of the week was the Assembly of the former war participants in Geneva. The Association which has more than 20 million members sent delegates from 35 countries. And so it happened that one side by side saw Israel and Egypt in an undisturbed neighborhood.

East Berlin the ghostly theme of civil war was on the agenda of the Soviet zonal Betriebskampfgruppen in East Berlin practice area was the Alexanderplatz square and according to order of the SED the battle group had the task to destroy a minority of counterrevolutionary enemies.

These days the magician of the sign monastery celebrated its 80. For the lonely artist birthday and a vivid Canary was the most beautiful holiday greeting. For half a century the demonic images of visionary art were born in this room. What lives in them is the terror and horror history who far rushed ahead our time to To find a terrible confirmation in the fact of the experienced present. In the black and white brilliant stroke of the pen Kubin has found the form and the formula of his art. Fascinated by the specter of his century he conjures up as man and as ban artists. Beauty is beauty is Trump recognized also the new Republicans from Ghana and sent their beauty queen on a friendship tour to London. The Englishman inherently know what deserves a Queen and so they sought warm heart to the blessings of civilization of the dark skinned beauty everywhere endeavours. How richly blessed is the tenth German Federal State with beauties which proved the excretion of the opal works for the election of Miss Saarbr cken in Saarbr cken Germany. The Saarland capital wanted to not bring discredit and sent a fine selection of avatar applicants in the fight to win the favor of the audience. The large sell off of beauty ended with the victory of a small vendor. It is called Helga Drosse and is for their 18 years in very good shape. Dazzling in form Germany s biceps matadors in the Mannheimer Muse Hall were Marathon of muscle. With a much younger team she participated to the international competition of muscles against France. The most impressive performance offered the lightweight Willi Kolb. With 115 kilograms he set a new German record in the two terms. But also the French did play their forces. The third Olympics Jean Debuf won in the Mittelschwergewicht. With a total of 24175 kilograms the French result by 30 kilograms was lighter than the weight the German team   brought to the high line. Thereby our muscle Prince celebrated a powerful success. A sensation on the trotting course weather enthusiastic Italians at the big lottery prize of Agnano experienced trotting sensation in Agnano. The French record holder Gelinotte is favored. Checco PRA and Assisi To give a brief Intermezzo as a front runner. But a horse from midfield dissolves after a few meters. Irresistible it passes on his rival. The followers of the Favorites are disappointed. It is namely not Gelinotte it is the 5 outsiders Tornese which the Sulky veteran Mario Santi imposes on a murderous trot. Yet is not all days evening. The experts talk about a waste of power. Until the final Sprint will prove it. And there s even Gelinotte. On the inside Lane she takes on the track. But her attack comes too late. Tornese WINS and once again ensures the good reputation of the unpopular outsider. Berlin football final country fighting mood of the 80000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium in the play off for the Berlin football championship between Hertha BSC  white shirts  and tennis Borussia. The game isn t even two minutes old when following a corner falls 1 0 to Hertha. A quarter of an hour later the Hertha storm is skillfully in the game brought. Powerful Faeder prevails against two defenders and completed a 2 0. After halftime the benefits clearly Hertha s page are. The Elf from the Gesundbrunnen dangerously harassed the sanctuary of the violet. A few counterattacks of the Borussia remain the fate of Borussias without resounding success the 50th minute sealed. Dove no. 8 takes a template to a 3 0 over the line. So Hertha BSC becomes 16. Male Berlin Championship and participates in the games for the German Championship. Fairy night along the Seine for a few hours sank the bitter reality of our days in a fairytale night along the Seine when Queen Elizabeth ascended to the ceremonial barge Borde Fretigny. France capital shone in the splendour of a thousand lights and on the banks of the Seine the most famous pictures from French history purchased on this magic nightabout 6 kilometres was the ride and over   a dream backdrop stretched 6 kilometers as it never was built.

" Schrecksbach   a village in Germany. On the map you looking it in futility. The name has a ring to it  four young people from Schrecksbach produce him. Klaus Roger Horst and Arno brought their village in the talk. They formed a pop band and called themselves the Petards   the firecrackers and succeeded in what remains the most provincial bands denied  she made a breakthrough into the national music scene. And what them almost as much was worth  she reconciled the conservative villagers with the new sound from her Bach of Schreck. The telephone  a news and communication device today for everyone. It began its triumphal March 100 years ago. Old phones from the beginning of the third bear witness in the museums of the Deutsche Bundespost. Whether electrical impulses are transported or letters and parcels  the technology is only a tool. Man plans and organises. Also in a State of the art operating like the Deutsche Bundespost. It is the largest service provider in Europe. Many letters and postcards are now automatically stamped and sorted. The daily deluge of 32 million items of correspondence forces to the use of machines. Electronics and automation can also help distribute packages. The post transported approximately 270 million units in the year. With nearly 500000 employees and a budget that is nearly a quarter of the federal budget the post is an important economic factor. This creates obligations. For example for the provision of training places. the Federal Post Office annually trains 10000 young people far more than she needs. Screen text and data transmission  the news technology of tomorrow has already begun. You increase the range of services. In spite of technological progress the post will carry always letters   to the remotest corners. This is possible only with human resources today   and tomorrow if the memory has faded of the beginnings of the communication. Ludwigsburg Palace a monument of the Baroque in the South of the Federal Republic and one of the largest castle in Germany. The Herzog von W rttemberg has let it build at the beginning of the 18th century. It reflects the personal representation joy of its inhabitants and the urge of the former royal houses to external power and magnificence. The huge garden is an architectural part of the palace complex. He is not preserved in its original state but was created 25 years ago in the baroque spirit after studying old templates  with Lakes fountains flowerbeds and avenues. The huge garden flourishing Baroque   with this promise attracts many thousands of visitors every summer. A complex system requiring constant and meticulous care to present themselves in that State which may have once been the purpose  as a shop window and mirror of an era in which a few powerful many subjects deems ruled. And like humans so they ordered also the nature. The Federal Republic of Germany otherwise a strike poor country experienced violent labor disputes in recent weeks. The reason  new technologies especially the electronics penetrate faster and faster in many sectors of the economy and change the quality of many jobs or make them superfluous. On the other hand modern technology is necessary to streamline so that competitiveness is not lost. You will create new jobs. There was the toughest labor dispute in the printing industry. Here the electronics threatened an entire profession  the typesetter. These skilled workers with strike fought for their jobs. Only emergency newspapers in Germany published for days on end. Lead fitters work according to tradition  produce the letters for the print templates in the machine or hand set. This technique remained unchanged since the invention of the printing press more than 500 years ago in principle. Now the lead of the electronics need to be different. Computer controlled text systems replace the ancient art of the typesetter. Before the screen sit the journalists themselves or only skilled typists and type the text into the computer. The results are final proofs from which the break editor composed the templates for the pages of the newspaper. The final artwork is then made in the light set procedure. The social consequences of this technology are now has been absorbed by a new collective agreement  on the display screen equipment typesetter are employed in the longer term primarily their previously obtained earnings is guaranteed them for their entire working life. And other professionals are trained to without any loss of income. Maximilian Horngacher the man who brings wood to the blades. Soloists and orchestral musicians from around the world call him the master of his Guild. In his small workshop in Munich he builds the harps that carry his name 14 16 year. With 5 employees he creates the 2400 items of a harp in hand work and then adds them together. Half a year passes by to cutting wood up to the voices of the finished instrument. The harp Maker uses 5 types of wood including maple mahogany and beech. The wood must be stored and dried be. Because the strings are later pull with a force of 2000 kg on the frame. The trains tongues pedals the entire mechanism together with the threads and screw is made in the workshop. Precision is everything for an instrument which must retain its sound quality in the tropics and in cold northern countries. When the harp body inlaid with gold leaf is decorated the strings are indented. The finished instrument is played by a professional harpist. Then comes this oldest stringed instrument in the world on the trip. Already a musician waiting in Rio Tokyo and San Francisco. No airport but a parking lot for the Science  the Deutsches Museum in Munich a unique repository for masterpieces of natural science and technology. 1.5 million visitors of which learn technology in a year a quarter from abroad be considered part of human cultural history. From Zeppelin to the satellite  chronological order makes visible development. On this working table of the German chemist Otto Hahn the atomic age began 40 years ago  Hahn discovered the uranium fission. Only the file boxes give information about all the wealth of the Museum  from rough mouth lack of money store 2 one third of the exhibits in underground depots.

The triple world champion Brazil against the Reigning champions Germany  an international match of the spectators in the sold out hamburger people Volksparkstadion is promised a gala show. For both teams a last showdown before the football World Cup in Argentina. The German players   in white shirts   start offensively.

As the playful Brazilians surprise with hardness and closed team game and take over as they are warm played soon the initiative. An accident return from Bonhof Ze Maria opened a scoring chance. On the other hand Bonhof trying his luck as a penalty kick specialist. Rarely attack the Germans on the wing. Their game is powerful and unimaginative. The Brazilians soon uncover the weaknesses of the world champion. You win the most battles disrupt the attacks of the Germans in the midfield and then quickly push forward. Bundestrainer good consults with his players at half time. But the recipe to interrupt the flow of the game the Brazilians does not take the German team. In the 76th minute s time  the Brazilian of Nunes scored the ball from goalkeeper Maier avoided untenable. A weak performance of the German national team and an impressive appearance of the Brazilian team that has solidified her favorite position in Argentina with their win against the world champions.

" Know then thyself presume not God to scan the proper study of Mankind is Man . Despite this wise imperative expressed by Alexander Pope in his Essay on Man  1733 34  the need to vindicate the ways of God to Man  has always interested the most intelligent minds in both philosophy and theology among them Plato Aristotle St Augustine William King Leibniz and Kant. Theodicy is the attempt to explain the paradoxical coexistence of suffering and Divine benevolence  why theodicists ask does God who is believed to be omniscient omnipotent and omnipresent permit evil to exist at all. The present volume studies the literary discussion of theodicy analysing a wide range of novels dramas and poetry from American Canadian Irish English French and German literatures. The essays   contributed by a team of internationally renowned scholars   discuss the poetic treatment of theodicy from the 17th and 18th centuries to the postmodern period  the catalogue of authors considered includes names such as Francis Bacon John Milton William King Daniel Defoe Jonathan Swift Samuel Johnson William Wordsworth Oscar Wilde Albert Camus John Fowles Ian McEwan and Irvine Welsh to name but a few. The book thus illustrates the close traditional affiliation between literature and theodicy and demonstrates that   at least during some phases of their common history   literature could be regarded as theodicy.

" For the first time in the history of the documenta the major event in Kassel was organized under the direction of a couple  Roger M. Buergel as the designated art director and Ruth Noack as curator. They served only unofficially  as a two member directorial team however as the documenta statutes do not allow for the possibility of two co directors. Together they developed a clearly defined programmatic concept under the banner of The Migration of Forms.  What that meant was that over the course of human history visual culture has had only a limited number of basic forms with which to work forms that have been used in different contexts and with different conceptual focuses throughout the history of art. Buergel Noack pointed out that contemporary does not mean that the works originated yesterday. They must be meaningful for people today. Documenta 12 is concerned with both historical lines of development in art and unexpected concurrences.  In order to bring these unexpected concurrences  to light relationships were established between works of art from different decades and cultures in which similar formal patterns have emerged a process that has led to a migration  of aesthetic forms across temporal and cultural boundaries culminating in the art of our postmodern world. This formalism was emphasized in the Neue Galerie by walls painted different colors. In turn this focus on the phenomenon of migration resulted in the selection of a high percentage of artists from Africa Asia and Eastern Europe. New to the program was the inclusion of old art from fourteenthcentury Persian miniatures to global art from recent decades. Artists already long since recognized in their own homelands such as Nasreen Mohamedi for example were not the only ones presented to a broad public in Germany for the first time. The works of several exemplary artists John McCracken Kerry James Marshall Charlotte Poseneske and Gerwald Rockenschaub also migrated through all exhibition venues. ",Germany
" Moreover the program of documenta 12 which incidentally boasted the largest share  roughly fifty percent  of women artists in the history of documenta was structured on the basis of three leitmotifs   First Is modernity our antiquity   Second What is bare life   And third What is to be done   The first leitmotif asks whether and to what extent our thinking and way of life are still pervaded by modern forms and visions   Buergel Noack . In a certain sense the second leitmotif takes up the theme of Jan Hoet s documenta 9 as it is concerned with the existential nature of the human being as a creature that is continually threatened in the postmodern era by torture terrorism and climate disasters. The third leitmotif shifted the problem of the  discursive  communication of art of aesthetic education   Buergel  into the focus of consideration. With that in mind Buergel Noack founded the international magazine project Documenta 12 magazines  in cooperation with the Vienna art publicist Georg Sch llhammer. ",Germany

" Next to the Aue pavilion temporarily erected on the Karlswiese for documenta 12  the largest single exhibition space covering 9500 square meters  the greenhouse conceived as a Crystal Palace  proved problematic not only in terms of climate control  stood Ai Weiwei s sculpture Template  2007  a tower built with centuries old doors recovered from destroyed Chinese houses  the tower collapsed during a storm and remained in place as a ruin . For Fairytale  2002  the Chinese artist had also invited 1001 fellow citizens of China to visit documenta in Kassel an invitation that caused a major stir in light of the political situation in China under its dictatorial regime and the ban on travel abroad. Ai had a wooden chair from the Qing dynasty brought to Kassel for each of the 1001 invited guests. The chairs were exhibited at the Museum Fridericianum the Aue pavilion and the Neue Galerie and used as islands of calm  for discussion within the context of the educational program. Ai s action placed the issue of migration  in a concrete political context while engaging history the present and timeless design in multifaceted dialogue at the same time. ",Germany
" Sanja Ivekovic planted his Mohnfeld  Field of Poppies 2007  in front of the Fridericianum. When the flowers burst into bloom the field was transformed into a Red Square  which in its ostensible beauty evoked wide ranging associations with the color red from the communist flag to the bloodshed in Afghanistan in connection with the cultivation of poppies for the production of heroin. Peter Friedl s The Zoo Story  2007  in documenta Halle was another of the more popular works shown in the exhibition. The stuffed threeand a half meter tall giraffe came from a zoo in the West Bank. It had panicked fallen and died of its injuries during an Israeli military operation. Friedl purchased the amateurish taxidermic specimen fashioned by the veterinarian at the zoo and had it shipped to Kassel where it was placed among garden carpets from Iran and stuffed animal sculptures by Cosima von Bonin. As a  political  work that is comprehensible only to those familiar with its history the zoo story  interrupts the migration of media images. ",Germany

In advance of the event an effort was made to establish especially close ties with Kassel through the documenta Advisory Council. Composed of forty interested citizens of Kassel who were involved in various aspects of concept development and communication the council played a particularly important role as an integral part of the curatorial composition.

" Neuschwanstein Castle   an example of Historicism ",Germany
" Ideal design for Neuschwanstein Castle by Christian Jank in 1868 which incorporated Richard Wagner s instructions for the set of Act 2 of the opera Lohengrin  east view of the Upper Courtyard with the keep and chapel in the centre ",Germany
" The government architect selected to convert Christian Jank s pictorial representations into plans was Eduard Riedel who had already redesigned Berg Palace for Ludwig s father in 1849 51. In accordance with the king s wishes Jank turned the robber knight s castle with late gothic elements that he had originally designed into a monumental Romanesque castle with a five storey Palas in the general style of the Wartburg Palas. Neuschwanstein which everyone now oddly enough thinks of as a typical medieval castle is thus not a copy of any existing building but a characteristic example of historicism in which architectural motifs from the Wartburg are combined with those of castles from medieval book illustrations. ",Germany
" It is significant that Jank s project was criticized for not being faithful to history. The painter Michael Welter who was recommended to the king by the castellan of Wartburg for his historical accuracy undertook to provide the necessary details for Neuschwanstein based on Romanesque examples and declared that Jank s final designs would incite the most virulent and bitter criticism. Court secretary D fflipp turned down Welter s proposals in a letter of 21 November 1871 for the following most revealing reasons  ",Germany
" It is the will of His Majesty the King that the new castle be built in the Romanesque style. We are now living in the year 1871 centuries after the period of the Romanesque style and there can be no doubt that the achievements that have since been attained in the areas of art and science will also benefit us in the construction of this building.   By this I do not in the least mean that we should alter the style itself in a way that would impair its character but neither do I mean that we should recreate the old days in every respect and not benefit from experience which would have been made use of them had it been available. ",Germany
" Bedroom  Oak bed with carvings by Anton P ssenbacher ",Germany
" Historicism frequently involved not just copying the historical styles but perfecting them using all the latest craft skills and technical means. For this reason the typical combination of modern  building  technology and historic architectural and furnishing styles was by no means considered a contradiction. This was also Ludwig II s philosophy so that the Romanesque castle of Neuschwanstein has a very modern kitchen hot air heating and numerous large tightly fitting windows with frames made of industrial steel. ",Germany
" The exterior of the castle became increasingly austere when Georg Dollmann succeeded Riedel in 1874 and many of the picturesque details in Jank s designs were dropped. In the sections completed in simplified form after 1886 this tendency increased. ",Germany
" Julius Hofmann who completed the complex on the basis of Riedel s plans from 1886 to 1892 designed the entire Romanesque interior of Neuschwanstein complete with furnishing in accordance with the king s ideas.

" Bemerkungen ",Germany
" 1968 gegr ndet stie en die vermeintlichen Urv ter des Prog eigentlich erst eher sp t 1971 mit ihrem dritten Album  The Yes Album  zur dominierenden Musikrichtung im England der 70er Jahre. Die ersten zwei Platten Yes und Time and a Word enthielten   von einigen Ausnahmen wie dem proggigen Then abgesehen   vorwiegend poppige Endsechziger Musik auf letztgenanntem mit vergleichsweise  The Nice Deep Purple  wenig  berzeugenden Orchesterexperimenten verunkl rt. ",Germany
" Mit der Ankunft des in verschiedenen Stilen versierten Gitarristen Steve Howe im Yes Lager  nderte sich das und die Band beschritt nun mutig einen Weg der sie zwischen 1971 und 1973  ber vier Alben von den noch recht simplen 10 Minuten St cken auf The Yes Album  vgl. I ve seen all good People das perfekt den  bergang von der fr hen Phase zu den Progalben markiert  zu einem ambitionierten und umstrittenen Konzeptwerk in vier Teilen f hren und damit in den Proghimmel katapultieren sollte. Dies ist vor allem der harten Hand Jon Andersons zu verdanken der h ufig recht dickk pfig seine zum Teil recht abgedrehten Ideen  von seinen esoterisch religi sen Texten mal ganz abgesehen  gegen den bodenst ndigeren Chris Squire durchsetzte. Diese Entwicklung ist in der Proggeschichte recht einmalig und macht einen gro en Teil der Faszination aus die bis heute f r viele von Yes ausgeht. Sie l  t sich am besten an den Hauptwerken Fragile und Close to the Edge ablesen gerade auf letzterem experimentierten Yes erstmals erfolgreich mit 20minutenst cken klassischen Strukturen  v. a. der Sonate  und Anleihen aus Barock  Siberian Khatru Close to the Edge  Psychedelic  Close to the Edge  Jazz  Siberian Khatru  und Fernost. ",Germany
" Die klassische Besetzung bestand aus Anderson dem Anf hrer Squire einem Bassisten der durch sein ungew hnlich melod ses Spiel weit mehr tat als nur die Grundlage f r den Bandsound zu legen dem Schlagzeuger Bill Bruford der vom Jazz kommend die Band auch in dieser Hinsicht die Grenzen traditioneller Rockmusik  berschreiten lie  Steve Howe der Country Elemente einbrachte und seit Fragile dem Keyboarder Rick Wakeman der mit seinem Spa  an den allerneusten Keyboards das Klangspektrum der Band erweiterte dar ber hinaus aber als erfahrener Arrangeur vor allem f r die Songstrukturen verantwortlich war. Seine Bedeutung f r die Band ist deutlich zu h ren wenn man die eher einfach gebauten Starship Trooper oder I ve Seen All Good People von The Yes Album mit den deutlich komplexer arrangierten St cken auf Fragile vergleicht. ",Germany
" Nach dem angesprochenen Mammutwerk Tales from Topographic Oceans auf dem die Band versuchte in einer Fu note eines Eso Bestsellers Angedeutetes in westlich anspruchsvolle Kulturt ne zu gie en stieg Wakeman der vornehmlich zwischen 1971 und 1973 wirkliche stilistische Akzente setzen konnte genervt aus. Ihm hatte man zu wenig Raum auf dem Album gelassen. Yes legten daraufhin mit Relayer ihre vielleicht mutigste und abgefahrenste Platte vor was nicht zuletzt dem Neuen Patrick Moraz zu verdanken ist  auch wenn der kaum mitkomponiert hat . Relayer ist deutlich st rker auf der jazzrockigen Seite ja es gibt sogar einige Musique Concr te Passagen zu h ren. Bis 1977 g nnte man sich dann eine Pause die jedes Bandmitglied mit einem Soloalbum f llte. Danach und unter Wiedernutzung der Wakemanschen Talente ging es weiter  Going for the One  bis Anderson und Wakeman gemeinsam nach katastrophal verlaufenen Aufnahmesessions in Frankreich f r den Nachfolger von Tormato selbst schon ein mediokres Album ausstiegen. Das entsprechende Album wurde gl cklicherweise nie ver ffentlicht einige Outtakes erschienen sp ter auf dem Sampler In a Word  Yes und auf den Rhino Reissues der Alben Tormato und Drama. ",Germany
" Nun 1980 zeigte sich da  Yes   entgegen den Beteuerungen der Rockpresse   nicht zuletzt eine Gitarrenband war  auch ohne die beiden vermeintlichen Protagonisten schaffen es die verbliebenen drei Mitglieder unter Mithilfe der Buggles  Video killed the Radio Star  Trevor Horn  Gesang  und Geoffrey Downes  Keyboards  mit Drama ein hervorragendes Album zu produzieren das trotz neuer Musiker nicht nur nach Yes klang sondern auch 100 ig Yes war. Dennoch brach 1980 die Band auseinander. ",Germany
" In gewisser Weise markiert dies das Ende der Band Yes  Der Ausstieg von Wakeman und Anderson als S nger f r viele Fans eine wichtige Identifikationsfigur sowie die Neuaufstellung der Musikindustrie Ende der 70er Jahre hinterlie en ihre Spuren. Seit dieser Zeit muss man Yes als ein Projekt bezeichnen  Die gemeinsamen Jahre waren vorbei zentrale Figuren waren zerstritten man heiratete und so kam es dass sich seit den fr hen 80er Jahren fast f r jedes neue Album eine neue Konstellation von Musikern zusammenfand. Die wechselnden Antipathien aber auch die sprunghaften Entwicklungen der Studiotechnik f hrten dazu dass kaum je wieder alle Bandmitglieder gemeinsam im Studio standen. Auch fand man sich immer nur zu Aufnahmen zusammen jenseits des Studios gingen sich die Musiker weitgehend aus dem Weg. Selbst bei Tourneen fuhren nicht alle gemeinsam im gleichen Tourbus. ",Germany
" Bis 1980 hatte die Band ihre Songs aus kleinen und kleinsten Ideen aller beteiligten Musiker zusammengebaut nun f hrte die Abkehr von der bew hrten kollektiven Kompositionsweise zu einem gravierenden stilistischen Wandel  Yes wurde eine Pop Rock Band. Verantwortlich daf r war der Druck der Plattenfirma. 1980 hatte Boss Ahmet Erteg n zu Chris Squire gesagt  Das n chste Album muss einen Singlehit haben . Da Yes aber keine Band ist die Hits schreiben kann und ohnehin kaum neues Material vorbereitet hatte war man froh auf die Hilfe des s dafrikanischen S nger und Gitarristen Trevor Rabin zur ckgreifen zu k nnen. Der hatte seit einiger Zeit verschiedenen Bands und Labels seine Demos angeboten Yes Atlantic griffen zu. Yes spielte seine Demos ein zun chst noch unter dem Namen Cinema doch weil Management und Plattenfirma der Meinung waren dass man mit dem am Markt etablierten Namen Yes erfolgreicher sein w rde als mit einem Namen der erst h tte neu eingef hrt werden m ssen holte man Jon Anderson und den ersten Keyboarder Tony Kaye in die Band zur ck und nannte die Band Yes. Ohne die beiden h tte es rechtliche Probleme mit dem Namen gegeben. ",Germany
" Nach zwei erfolgreichen Alben 90125 und Big Generator verlie  Anderson frustriert die Band. Zeitweise existierten dann zwei Yes gleichzeitig  eine Band unter dem Namen Yes eine unter dem Namen Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. Nach einem rein finanziell motivierten Wiedervereinigungsveruch 1990 mit einer achtk pfigen Band und dem hektisch zusammengeschusterten Album Union versuchte man halbherzig an den Stil der 70er Jahre anzukn pfen teils in der 80er Besetzung  Talk  teils in der klassischen Besetzung mit Wakeman und Howe  Keys to Ascension  doch der Poprock setzte sich durch vor allem forciert von Chris Squire. ",Germany
" Gleichzeitig erlebte der Progressive Rock einen zweiten Fr hling  Bands wie Spock s Beard oder die Flower Kings kn pften an die Musik der 1970er Jahre an. Wer aber erwartet hatte dass Yes oder die reformierten ELP sich nun an die Spitze des neuen Trends setzen w rden wurde entt uscht. Pers nliche Querelen standen dem ebenso im Weg wie die stilistische Ausrichtung an einem Massengeschmack dessen Tr ger jedoch die Band nach und nach verlie en. Yes wurde mit Alben wie Keys to Ascension Open your Eyes und The Ladder musikalisch zu einer sich selbst zitierenden Randerscheinung und die Verkaufszahlen nahmen zusehends ab. ",Germany
" Dass Yes seit den fr hen 90er Jahren keinen festen Plattenvertrag mehr hatten und von Album zu Album wieder aufs Neue Klinken putzen mussten war der Situation der Band nicht gerade zutr glich. Ein Tiefpunkt war 1997 erreicht als die Band nach einem Wechsel zu Eagle Beyond auf Tournee gehen wollten die Plattenfirma sie aber nicht lie  weil sie ohne ein neues Produkt halb leere Hallen bef rchtete. Da Yes aber kein neues Material hatten wurde kurzerhand das Material eines Nebenprojekts von Chris Squire und Billy Sherwood zum Yes Album Open your Eyes umfunktioniert. ",Germany
" Auch die n chsten Alben erschienen bei unterschiedlichen Plattenfirmen die mangels Verkaufserfolgen immer weniger Geld in die Produktionen investierten. Nach der Ver ffentlichung des Albums Magnification im Jahre 2001 einer Zusammenarbeit mit gro em Orchester die auf m  ige Begeisterung und niedrige Verkaufszahlen stie  und anschlie enden Touren ebenfalls kostspielig mit Orchestern zog sich die Band aufgrund interner Streitereien zur ck und beschr nkte sich aufs  Wieder ver ffentlichen von Compilations Boxen und DVDs. Alle Mitglieder verfolgten Solo  oder Nebenprojekte darunter Conspiracy und The Syn  Chris Squire  Anderson   Wakeman White  Alan White  Asia  Steve Howe  und Yoso  Billy Sherwood Tony Kaye Bobby Kimball . Als Anderson die Band aus gesundheitlichen Gr nden verlassen musste und deshalb sogar eine Tournee platzte suchten sich die verbleibenden Mitglieder Squire White und Howe Ersatz in Person von Beno t David S nger einer Yes Coverband. Zeitweise war auch Rick Wakemans Sohn Oliver Mitglied er wurde jedoch 2011 von Drama Keyboarder Geoff Downes ersetzt um das neuen Album Fly from here als eine Art Neuauflage der Drama Besetzung vermarkten zu k nnen. ",Germany
" Doch auch Fly from here stie  nicht mehr auf die Begeisterung der Fans  Erneut fuhr ein Studioalbum rote Zahlen ein. Um die Verluste auszugleichen schickte Yes  neue Plattenfirma das italienische Oldielabel Frontiers Records die Band auf lange Tourneen auf denen sie ausschlie lich ihre alten Klassiker spielte   etwas dass sie seit der Keys to Ascension  re Mitte der 90er Jahre ohnehin schon getan hatte. Die Setlisten dieser letzten 20 Jahre  hnelten einander auff llig und rekrutierten sich vor allem aus den Alben The Yes Album Fragile Close to the Edge und Going for the One. Neue St cke wurden allenfalls sporadisch gepielt. ",Germany
" Inzwischen hatte Jon Davison vorher bei Glass Hammer Beno t David ersetzt weil dieser im Gegensatz zu seinem Vorg nger selbst Songs schrieb. Es wurde offensichtlich dass Yes dringend neues Material ben tigten  schon Fly from here hatte zu gro en Teilen aus alten Ideen aus den 80er Jahren bestanden . Die Einsparungen bei den Aufnahmen zum n chsten Album Heaven   Earth wurden diesmal noch drastischer  Die Band war vor den Aufnahmen kaum komplett versammelt vielmehr reiste Davison mit seinen Demos von einem Mitglied zum n chsten. Zudem erlaubte Frontiers Yes nicht einmal die H fte der Zeit die sie normalerweise im Studio ben tigen. Entsprechend sparsam waren Songwriting und Produktion. Dazu kam dass Band und Plattenfirma mit der Produktion unzufrieden war  Die Musik habe einfach nicht nach Yes geklungen. Am Ende wurde Billy Sherwood damit betraut die Aufnahmen zu  berarbeiten.

" Located close to F ssen in the Allg u region of Bavaria Neuschwanstein is widely acknowledged to be the most beautiful castle in the world and has been consistently voted Germany s top tourist attraction. ",Germany
" A fairytale vision ",Germany
" The castle was built in the late eighteen hundreds at enormous expense by  Mad  King Ludwig II and took a staggering twenty five years to complete. The King was an eccentric passionate about architecture and music but completely uninterested in politics and matters of state. He dragged his country into financial ruin building dozens of castles and palaces each one more magnificent and outlandish than the last. He died in mysterious circumstances on one of Bavaria s many splendid lakes the Starnberger See several years before Neuschwanstein was finished. Had he lived the King would have been truly proud of his final creation inspired by close friend Richard Wagner s operas Lohengrin and Tannh user. ",Germany
" Magnificent from afar.. ",Germany
" The white castle whose multiple turrets were the inspiration for Disney Group s Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella castles is poised on an outcrop of rock towering over a gorge in the River P llat. The surrounding woodland landscape changes with the seasons guaranteeing a spectacular view whichever time of year you choose to visit. The most remarkable vista is from the nearby Marienbr cke a bridge that spans rushing waters in the ravine below. ",Germany
" ..and from up close ",Germany
" Horse drawn carriages and buses are available to take the pain out of the steep climb from the car park to the castle gatehouse which is flanked by turrets and set with crenellations and the royal coat of arms. Tickets include the price of a guided tour which starts with a walk past the many apartments in the upper courtyard through to the main part of the castle where you ll find the lavishly painted reception known as the Minstrel s Room. Further on is the Throne Room decorated with gilded mural paintings mosaics and a tremendous chandelier. Ironically the gold and ivory throne that King Ludwig had planned to sit on was never made. Lastly there is a picturesque gallery with a spiral staircase that leads to the top of the highest turret affording breathtakingly views of the surrounding countryside. ",Germany
" It can be busy ",Germany
" One and a half million tourists visit Neuschwanstein every year and in summer 6000 people pass through the gatehouse every day so advance booking is essential. Prices are very reasonable  entrance to the castle costs around  13 per adult and is free for children but if you intend to visit nearby Hohenschwangau where King Ludwig grew up Linderhof where he rowed a golden swan boat on a lake inside an artificial grotto or the Herrenchiemsee Palace where he built a Hall of Mirrors that gives Versailles a run for its money think about buying a Bavarian castles and palaces season ticket. Valid for two weeks it gives access to over forty properties for around  44 for a family of four. ",Germany
" If time is limited but you re a detailed person guided day trips operate from many local towns including Garmisch Partenkirchen. If booked online they cost between  130    160 per person and usually include other stopping off points like Germany s highest mountain peak the Zugspitze Oberammergau home of the famous Passion Play or the majestic Benedictine monastery Ettel Abbey. ",Germany
" Getting there made easy ",Germany
" Bavaria has an extensive rail and bus network and it is perfectly possible to tour the region without a car. For Neuschwanstein first take the train to F ssen. From there it s a short bus ride to the castle. Buses depart every ten minutes. If you re using public transport buy a Bayern Ticket either online or from a vending machine. The ticket is valid for one day s unlimited travel aand for a family of four will cost around  43. ",Germany
" If you do hire a car make the most of your visit to Neuschwanstein by following the nine mile driving tour around the castle which takes in Hohenschwangau the Marienbrucke the Tegelbahn cable car  it runs to the summit of Mount Tegel and overlooks recently discovered Roman ruins  and the small but distinctive Kolomanskirche a Baroque church that stands quite alone at the foot of the Schwangauer Berge. ",Germany
" Sightseeing can be hungry work ",Germany
" A free multivision show about Bavaria s historic sights at the Caf  and Bistro eatery on the second floor of the castle means you don t even need to stop sightseeing whilst you whilst you take a break. There is another franchise of the same bistro just outside the castle gate. ",Germany
" There are a number of inns and restaurants in the nearby village of Schwangau where you can eat at a leisurely pace whilst enjoying the exterior views. Schlossbrauhaus Schwangau is a Bavarian microbrewery with a rustic interior a few minutes walk from the castle. ",Germany
" The Rohrkopfh tte has an alpine cabin theme and a veranda with panoramic views over the valley. It specialises in the use of fresh seasonal ingredients. ",Germany

" Neuschwanstein is a great stopping off point for tourists travelling along the Romantic Road which starts in Lindau on Lake Constance and ends 280 miles away in Salzburg. But the surrounding area is also great for longer vacations. Schwangau although small offers accommodation to suit all tastes and has an amazing spa with thermal baths saunas and treatment rooms.

" On the Way to Nosferatu by Enno Patalas  Unterwegs zu Nosferatu. Vorstellung einer Rekonstruktion in  Filmblatt No. 18 7 2002  ",Germany
" Murnau s Nosferatu was never a  lost film . Unlike Der Gang in die Nacht  Journey into the Night  Phantom Die Finanzen des Gro herzogs  The Finances of the Grand  Duke  and Der brennende Acker  Burning Earth  Nosferatu has always been with us in various different forms. This is largely thanks to Henri Langlois and the Cin math que Fran aise who preserved a copy of the second French version dated 1926 or 1927. This version contained the famous title which had so delighted Breton  Et quand il fut de l autre c t  du pont les fant mes vinrent   sa rencontre   which could be seen as an admittedly free but by no means inappropriate translation of the original German text  Kaum hatte Hutter die Br cke  berschritten da ergriffen ihn die unheimlichen Gesichte... It was a print from this version that reached the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1947. There as was the norm in Iris Barry s time the foreign language intertitles were translated into English. In the process the names of the characters  which in the French version had roughly approximated to the German names  were changed to the names of the characters in Bram Stoker s Dracula which the film is of course based on. In this it followed the first American version of the film. Orlok thus became Dracula Hutter became Jonathan Harker Knock  who had been Knox in the French version   Renfield Bulwer   Van Helsing... and Wisborg became Bremen. This is the form in which the film returned to Europe firstly to London and the National Film Archive and thence to Germany to a distribution company which was in the  60s performing a valuable role in making  Weimar cinema  available to a wider public. This company translated the English titles back into German retaining the altered names.  When copies were needed for export into francophone countries they translated the German titles   which had been translated from the English titles which themselves had been translated from the French   back into French. The film is still shown in this form in Goethe Institutes in Montreal Brussels Toulouse and Paris. The descriptions of the film to be found in issue no. 228 1979 of l Avant Sc ne Cin ma and in Bouvier Leutrat s 1981 book are also based on this version.  At the same time the graphic form of the intertitles was standardised from one version to the next and there was a loss in image quality down the generations. There is a story   I do not know whether it is true   that Henri Langlois used to remove the intertitles from prints of silent films. What is certain is that he was not very interested in preserving or restoring them. This was in marked contrast to Lotte Eisner who was aware of the importance of titles   at least in German films of the  20s   and who inspired me 20 years ago to begin searching for the titles of Der m de Tod  Destiny  and also Nosferatu which were thought lost. The evidence of the script and title list from Murnau s estate which Lotte had secured for the Cin math que Fran aise   and which are reproduced in facsimile in the appendix to the German edition of her book on Murnau   suggested that such a search might be worthwhile. From them we discovered that in the known prints of French provenance a sixth of the intertitles were missing  16 out of the original 97 not counting the 19 act  and opening and closing credit titles  and that many of the remaining titles differed greatly from the original text. We also discovered that writing in the film had originally had a far greater importance than the French version and its descendants had suggested. This was true not only of Nosferatu but also of Caligari The Golem and Fritz Lang s Der m de Tod and Dr. Mabuse. In the most important German films of the early  20s intertitles served not only as headings and to convey dialogue. The Caligari titles painted by Hermann Warm are a continuation of the sets also designed by Warm while working the other way round painted words  You must become Caligari   suddenly appear in the sets. In Der m de Tod the graphic style of the intertitles  which I found as flash titles in a print in the Moscow archive  are related to the place time and background story of the three episodes. The Golem titles bear the signature of the designer of the ghetto sets Hans Poelzig. In Nosferatu the action was linked to three books  to the  diary  a kind of chronicle of the plague whence the action initially emerges and into which it finally returns  to secondly the vampire book that Hutter finds in the Carpathian inn   just as one might find a Bible in a hotel room today   which shows him and his wife their future  and finally to the ghost ship s log book. In these books the action never simply moves on   rather the books edge what is seen and shown into a shadowy half light   from both the characters  and the viewer s point of view. There are in addition letters a page from a newspaper and various official documents. The well known French version and those based on it ascribed the  diary  to Johann Carvallius or Cavallius ancien magistrat et habile historien de sa ville natale. In Murnau s title list on the other hand the keeper of the diary is anonymous without fame or title. His signature is three crosses   three properly painted graveyard crosses are specified in the title list   a voice from beyond the grave. This was obviously too irrational for whoever put together the French version. The greatest works of the German cinema of the early  20s almost without exception make reference to  author less  literary genres traditional or modern   to anonymous testimonies and traditions to folk tale legend books of magic chronicles as well as crime novels and science fiction but almost never to the work of well known writers. Fritz Lang made no distinction between filming a story from a newspaper serial such as Dr. Mabuse or a saga like Die Nibelungen and when Murnau was shooting his Faust he followed not Goethe but the medieval folk epic. The anonymity of the storyteller his voice from beyond the grave is not the only pointer in Nosferatu signalling the disintegration of the bourgeois author and the bourgeois hero. The story teller who signs his work with three graveyard crosses matches the vampirical Count who finally disappears in a puff of smoke a creature somewhere between human and animal between life and death a hermaphrodite like the flesh eating plant with which he is compared in the film.  And Ellen in the first dialogue title of the film talks of the flowers Hutter has picked for her as though they were living beings  Why did you kill them  she asks. Again it is certainly no coincidence that this title is among those deleted in the French version.  It is therefore not a sign of inconsistency when Murnau having used 116 intertitles in seven different forms in Nosferatu then inspired by Carl Mayer followed the example of Scherben  Shattered  and Sylvester  New Year s Eve  and made Der letzte Mann  The Last Laugh  almost without titles explaining that the ideal film is one without any intertitles whatsoever. The proliferation of non literary pre literary popular and anonymous forms of speech and writing already goes some way towards dissolving the link between cinema and literature the most sustained expression of this effect being the title less film which rests entirely on the image. The significance of the intertitles of the Ur Nosferatu is evidenced by the title list but is illustrated even more clearly in a print preserved in the Staatliche Filmarchiv der DDR  the GDR State Film Archive  which was made available to the M nchner Filmmuseum in 1980 for our first attempt at a reconstruction. Albin Grau who was also responsible for the sets and costumes had done the lettering. They are like shot set ups within the film proper and fade in and out. Pages are turned. This print from the GDR Archive was of course no more than a skeleton but it did contain most of the titles and at least examples of almost all types of titles and inserts occurring in the film credit and dialogue titles the diary the vampire book the log book letters etc. Only the titles indicating start and end of acts were missing. This print enabled us in the  80s to make new prints of the titles or to letter them ourselves in a faithful copy of the original or to put together and then film the background elements with their text. Also in 1980 Mary Meerson made available to us another version of Nosferatu from the holdings of the Cin math que. It was again Lotte Eisner who had alerted the world to the existence of this version in an article for the January 1958 issue of Cahiers du Cin ma entitled L Enigme des deux Nosferatu. It was about a version with the title Die zw lfte Stunde   The Twelfth Hour   which a certain Dr. Waldemar Roger had assembled in 1930 with the intention of releasing it with sound   not optical sound but  stylus sound  i.e. a combination of film and gramophone record. This version contained a series of additions mostly designed to provide visual justification for the use of music. Many parts were changed around in order to give the film a happy ending for example. Again and again sequences and single shots had been shortened. The intertitles were completely new and quite different. There are however long sections where this re edit has obviously left the original shot sequence untouched. This provided us with several shots that we had previously known in either abbreviated versions or in poor condition or indeed had not known at all. These we could now add into the reconstruction. Intertitles are not the only aspect of  20s cinema which was neglected   if not actually despised   by the post war generation of cinephiles  colour is another. They came to know and love the cinema of this era in the black and white prints via which it was handed down to them. This was of course in a period when the passage from blackand  white to colour was as controversial as the change from silent to sound film had been twenty years earlier. The Cin math que print of the second French version of Nosferatu was black and white as were all the prints made from it as well as those preserved in East Berlin and also Die zw lfte Stunde. Nosferatu must have been in colour at the time of its release in 1922    tinted  and perhaps also  toned . We make this assumption not only because this was normal in Germany at the time but also because a vampire does not walk around in broad daylight as he does in all the black and white prints of the film. A definite indication that Nosferatu was intended to be coloured was found in Act 5 of the film. In the shot where the wind blows a candle out in this exact place there was a splice demonstrating that the sections before and after had been printed separately the first to be coloured yellow or orange for candle light and the second blue or green for night and moonlight. We do not know unfortunately how much influence Murnau exerted on the colouring of his films. I only remember one note in his handwriting in the script of Schloss Vogel d  Castle Vogeloed  saying Leave the dream scenes black and white.  Strangely the relevant page has in the meantime disappeared from the script preserved in the Biblioth que du Film.  He obviously left the rest of the colouring to the laboratory staff making the prints. The original intertitles also indicate that Nosferatu was very much conceived as a day and night film. At the beginning of the film every change in the time of day is announced by a title  ... at last the Carpathian peaks lit up before him Hurry the sun is setting  As soon as the sun rose the terrors of the night left Hutter  followed by a twilight image   a mountain view clouds or seascapes always without people. Later in the film the twilight images function alone without introductory title to mark the change from day to night and vice versa. In the mid  80s Luciano Berriatua of the Filmoteca Espa ola an eminent Murnau scholar found another print of Nosferatu in the depths of the Cin math que vaults a print which even Lotte Eisner herself had obviously failed to find. It was a coloured copy of the first  1922  French version of the film  about which Robert Desnos had written long before Breton had noted the film . Parts of the film were missing due to deliberate cuts by the distribution company as well as normal wear and tear on the print and the colours had altered considerably   the blue of the night scenes had disappeared completely and Nosferatu was again walking in the sunshine. Nevertheless it was still possible to see which colour had been allocated to which section. We could also tell that the French distributor had   as was normal at the time   received the coloured positive print from Germany producing only the French titles in France. One could therefore assume that the French version was based on the same colouring plan as the German version. This made it obvious that night scenes had sometimes been coloured blue and green even when a lamp was visible as the light source and one would therefore have expected yellow. In the scene at the Carpathian inn in Act 1 blue exterior shots alternate with yellow interiors as was the convention at the time but in the scenes in Hutter and Ellen s apartment in the final act when Nosferatu is sucking Ellen s blood blue exteriors alternate with green interiors. Green alternating with blue underlines the eeriness of these scenes which suggests that when Hitchcock was deciding on the colouring for The Lodger he remembered the music hall melodramas he saw as a child where the villain was always bathed in green light. Twilight images in Nosferatu were originally coloured pink as a rule with only one   the shot with the flesh eating plant the venus fly trap   coloured orange. In 1994 the Cineteca del Comune di Bologna undertook in the context of the European Community s Lumi re Project to continue the reconstruction which had begun in Munich. First a black and white negative was printed from the Paris colour print on to panchromatic stock. All missing incomplete or damaged shots were replaced from the two other nitrate prints in the Cin math que Fran aise a nitrate dupe negative of the second French version and a nitrate positive print of Die zw lfte Stunde. A colour positive print was struck from this black and white negative using the method developed by No l Desmet at the Cin math que Royale de Belgique  A neutral blackand  white image is first struck from a black and white negative and printed on to a positive colour emulsion...  this image is then exposed without negative to the desired colour by flashing coloured light on to it. The result is a black and white image on a tinted background. In addition to the 522 shots of the well known version   not including titles and inserts   a further thirty gradually found their way into the reconstruction. Most are single shots or more rarely two or three within a sequence. Only in one place is there a short sequence of five new shots together  in a scene with Harding and Ruth playing croquet . Other shots are now longer and fade in and out where there had previously been  hard  cuts or the image quality has been improved. An extra 400 metres has been added to the 1562 metres of the well known version so that no more shots should now be missing from the original 1967 metres length. Even more of a b te noire to old school film buffs than the colouring and toning of prints is the practice of presenting them with musical accompaniment. Henri Langlois was not it seems always dedicated to showing  silent films  silent and in the early days he would have Joseph Kosma accompany them on the piano. Certainly musical accompaniments in the silent film era were normally an element in bringing a film to the people rather than a part of the film s artistic creation and it took a new interest in this aspect of cinema history a desire to look beyond auteur theory to persuade film archives and cin math ques to start concerning themselves with the music. There are however indications that directors such as Lang and Murnau were no more indifferent to the musical accompaniment than they were to the colour or indeed to any part of the technical aspect of their films. We discover from the title list handed down by Lotte Eisner that the credits of the Ur Nosferatu give Hans Erdmann as the composer of the original music for the film just as the Nibelungen and Metropolis title lists name Gottfried Huppertz. Erdmann was a conductor composer and music critic and from 1926 edited the journal Film   Ton   Kunst   Film   Sound   Art  . In 1927 together with Giuseppe Becce he published the Handbuch der Film Musik. In 1932 he wrote the music for Fritz Lang s Testament des Dr. Mabuse. Erdmann and Becce have reported that before completing his films Murnau used to discuss the music with the composers. Erdmann composed his Nosferatu score as a suite which he called Fantastisch Romantische Suite. It was published in two arrangements one for full orchestra and one for palm court orchestra. The score contains ten titles   Idyllic Lyrical Ghostly Stormy Destroyed Strange Grotesque Unchained Distraught. None of the ten pieces wrote Erdmann in an open letter to an orchestra director who had attacked the composition as too highbrow was planned in such a way that it must always be used in the form provided. It is of course possible to do so but by no means obligatory. The suite was used in the cinemas of Berlin with varying degrees of success. Sometimes very good effects were produced but in other cases the results were less satisfactory. I finally heard this music arranged by the Berlin musicologist Berndt Heller and played by the DEFA Symphony Orchestra  now called the Babelsberg Film Orchestra  during a presentation of the film in a church in Neu Ruppin in the Brandenburg Marches. What struck both Heller and myself completely independently was how the musical and colouring effects reinforced each other. ",Germany

" ... Nature participates in the action  sensitive editing makes the bounding waves foretell the approach of the varnpire the imminence of the doom about to overtake the town. Over all these landscapes   dark hills thick forests skies of jagged storm clouds   there hovers what Balazs calls the great shadow of the supernatural. ... The architecture in Nosferatu typically Nordic   brick fa ades with stubby gables   is perfectly adapted to the film s strange plot. Murnau did not have to distort the little Baltic townscapes with contrasting lighting effects  there was no need for him to increase the mystery of the alleyways and squares with an artificial chiaroscuro. Under Murnau s direction the camera of Fritz Arno Wagner required no extraneous factors to evoke the bizarre. ... Murnau created an atmosphere of horror by a forward movement of the actors towards the camera. The hideous form of the vampire approaches with exasperating slowness moving from the extreme depth of one shot towards another in which he suddenly becomes enormous. Murnau had a complete grasp of the visual power that can be won from editing and the virtuosity with which he directs this succession of shots has real genius. Instead of presenting the whole approach as a gradual process he cuts for a few seconds to the reactions of the terrified youth returns to the approach then cuts it off abruptly by having a door slammed in the face of the terrible apparition  and the sight of this door makes us catch our breath at the peril lurking behind it.

" ... Man hat Murnau zu Recht nachger hmt und darin einen exemplarisch  modernen  Zug seiner Film sthetik ausgemacht dass es bei ihm in einem einzigen Film ganz verschiedenartige Bildauffassungen Kadrierungen Lichtsituationen gebe. Neuere Forschungen haben nachweisen k nnen dass Murnau das verschiedenartigste ikonographische Material der Kunstgeschichte aber auch das seiner Zeit   etwa das Werk Franz Marcs   f r seine Film sthetik adaptierte und so der Formentwicklung des Films erschloss.   Jan Berg Reclams elektronisches Filmlexikon ",Germany
" ... Despite the detailed research of M. Bouvier and J. L. Leutrat the question of how Nosferatu came to be made is still something of a mystery. Virtually the only film produced by Prana Film   a financial sinking ship whose owners were subsequently taken to court for copyright violations by Bram Stoker s widow despite having changed most of the characters  names   the project owed much to the enigmatic figure of Albin Grau who signed for the decor and costumes but also seems to have been the driving force behind the production both financially and artistically. Very little is known about Grau though a recent article by Enno Patalas depicts him variously as a student of eastern philosophy a freemason and master of the  pansophic lodge of the light seekers  in Berlin a fan of Aleister Crowley a friend of novelist painter Alfred Kubin and the author of a pamphlet about the use of colour in decor and lighting in black and white films. More predictable collaborators were film industry professionals screenwriter Henrik Galeen  who co wrote The Golem  and director of photography Fritz Arno Wagner one of the three top cameramen at Ufa. ... Nosferatu is a film about networks of contagion and contamination that are also networks of secret and subversive communication. ... The French surrealists admired Nosferatu mainly for its eroticism contrasting the anodyne puppy love of Mina and Harker with Nosferatu s necrophiliac lust musty and potent at once exuding the aroma of dank crypts and leathery flesh. According to Robin Wood on the other hand sexuality is branded in Murnau s films as the source of evil  Nosferatu stands for raw carnal desire which must be kept in check in the interest of higher spiritual values and so Mina expressing that mixture of desire curiosity and horror typical of patriarchal culture s depiction of female sexuality must die along with the vampire. But the love triangles in the film also lend themselves to an interpretation that brings out a more layered structure of sexual attraction and ambivalence. For instance underlying the secret heterosexual bond between Nosferatu and Mina is the Renfield Harker Nosferatu relation. The initial situation suggests that the film superimposes two plotlines one heterosexual the other developed around the homosexual relationship between Nosferatu and Renfield doubled by the homosocial story of Harker being befriended by Renfield whereupon the older man introduces his younger friend to a very  experienced  queen. ...

" Based illegally on Bram Stoker s Dracula F.W. Murnau s film is undeniably the best and probably the most faithful of the myriad of films based on the novel. Naively the film s producers attempted to circumvent the author s estate s copyright by changing the names and central location of the film. ... Max Schreck s role as the vampire was for many years after the completion of the film shrouded in legend probably in no small part due to Schreck s apt name  Schreck translates from German as fright fear terror horror . Some believed or were encouraged to believe that Murnau had taken the role or that The Count was playing himself. Such tales are unfortunately untrue. Schreck may have been given the role because of his name but he had been associated with Max Reinhardt s Berlin company as had many of Murnau s collaborators. Schreck had an undistinguished film career apart from his role as the vampire appearing in Murnau s The Grand Duke s Finances the year after Nosferatu. Murnau himself had been a student of then actor and finally assistant to Reinhardt before the war taking up filmmaking in 1919. Murnau was a perfectionist and a name alone would not have been sufficient reason to cast someone in a pivotal role. Schreck s emaciated ungainly appearance combined with his character s rodent like features and the vampire s lengthening fingernails creates cinema s ugliest vampire and fits with the film s aesthetic and theme of the vampire as the contagion of the epidemic that spread throughout Europe  vampire   rats   as a symbol of a diseased and corrupted aristocracy feeding off the vitality and youth of the young. This is different from the novel where the vampire is a suave and sophisticated seducer who is more akin to the sexual threat of Hammer s Christopher Lee. Here the relationship is more predatory than sexual. This is the natural order. The fatal disease is due to the parasite feeding off the living. Dr. Van Helsing shows his students a Venus fly trap devouring a fly and a polyp with mouth and tentacles consuming its live victim. Life is the fear of death and disease.

" Disc 1 contains a monocoloured sepia version disc 2 an original b w version of the film which was released from the very beginning in a five colour tinting. The trailer claims that this version is based on the last surviving print found in Germany   a marketing lie as Eureka s Ron Benson had to admit to Enno Patalas. The credits invoke the National Archives Film Archives Koblenz Town Museum Film Museum Munich and German Cinematic Foundation Berlin  sic   but in reality Eureka s version of the film is based on the 1981 Munich restauration  which at least contains some sequences not included on the Image Entertainment discs . The digital clean up that was done for this edition at IML Digital Media Melbourne is so far the best digital processing of any German classic film on DVD. The graphics of the intertitles also follow basically the 1981 Munich restauration. The commentary is the same as on the Image DVDs but spoken by an actor who tries in a involuntarily comical way to be emphatic. Roy Benson assured that the copyright holders Transit Film and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung not only licensed but also offered this obsolete 1981 version without an alternative offer of the 1995 Bologna restauration.  Enno Patalas  ... the release of silent features and earlie talkies is hampered by all sorts of problems usually connected with the state of the elements but also the proper copyright licensing.

" At igr we know that New approaches to urban development and spatial planning are required  for available space decreases while demands increase . ",Germany
" Urban development and spatial planning face new challenges. Space for essential urban development is frequently unavailable in towns and cities. In the countryside there is a growing problem with empty buildings and a rural exodus. These effects of demographic changes are increasingly influencing planning considerations. Globalisation new forms of media and the rising demands of climate protection have all contributed significantly to a change in urban development processes. Active citizens  involvement is also exerting ever greater influence on planning processes. Our task is to recognize analyse and find lasting solutions to the complexity of connections involved in urban development. ",Germany

" Zombies In Miami   Groove Podcast 258 ",Germany
" Zombies In Miami s Canibal and Jenice   last names are for the living   look a lot healthier than their moniker implies however they do also not seem to catch much sleep. In just about ten years the Mexican duo has released a stunning series of EPs on labels like Correspondant Bordello A Parigi or 2MR before signing to the German Permanent Vacation for their forthcoming debut album and launching their own label aptly titled Creatures Of The Night. All while pursuing their respective solo careers taking up DJing and working on their live project Planet ZIM of course. Zombie In Miami s mix for our Groove podcast reveals that there is even more to expect from the two  in between music from Mexican and international friends you ll find the occasional unreleased tune by themselves. ",Germany
" First off how are you doing and what have you been up to  We are doing well we have been working in the studio on new music lots of remixes and upcoming new projects while dealing with the quarantine. We are tying to be productive besides producing music so we are gardening and building things in our countryside house. ",Germany
" You have taken part in the virtual RicoFest and contributed music to compilations like Empat a by Born In Mexico highlighting your home country s local scene. How do the consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic affect you and other Mexican musicians economically  Does the state support you are there initiatives from within the music community  RicoFest was a virtual festival organized by the Rico a multi cultural and LGBTQI  club in Mexico City. They have a really cool vibe there with different music in each floor. They invited us to play months ago and we enjoyed the experience so they invited us again for the festival. All the proceeds were given to the staff drag queens and artists involved. Born In Mexico its our booking agency platform and home in the country since 2014. The compilation Empat a is an initiative started by the crew to show empathy with the local artists and fans in these difficult days. It features some of the best Mexican producers like Pepe Mogt Vongold Balcazar S ss Pinto Cabizbajo Mystery Affair and more. It s 50 50 female and male. The pandemic has affected Mexican musicians promoters and clubs very severly we started the quarantine one week after Europe. We were touring in Japan when things became crazy and we had to cancel the rest of our tour in Asia and Australia. From May till August we had a tour booked in Europe which of course now is cancelled. The gouvernment hasn t helped us unlike in European countries the prospects for the Mexican scene and the economy as a whole are very dark. Some DJs who made a living just with music had to find other ways to survive because a lot of people in Mexico live day by day. ",Germany
" After almost a decade of activity you have released almost 20 releases and are currently preparing your debut album to be released later this year on Permanent Vacation. What can you already tell us about the record  We are more than happy to finally have the album ready. It took years to find the right moment to put out this collection of tracks which represents our ten year long journey our travels adventures good times and the musical development of our sound. It s an album full of Zombies In Miami sounds like italo house disco and our own classic vibe  We made eight tracks and we think it s a great musical story. We have just released our first single called Frodo  and the next one will be Disco Nostalgia.  We cant wait to share it with all the world  Also we are inviting friends for a special remix release after the album. ",Germany
" How did you approach writing it in comparison to the many EPs you have put out so far  We started to make this album in the beginning of 2019. We already had some solid ideas and took two months off to work only on the album. Usually when you are producing an EP you are trying to make a banging single or a solid record for the dancefloor. With the album we tried to tell a story with different rhythms that are not 100  four to the floor some ambient tracks and lots of melodies. We were relaxed and inspired doing this because we didn t have any pressure from the label and were free to do whatever we wanted. We are so happy to release our album on such a fine label like Permanent Vacation. Since the beginning of our Zombies in Miami career we wanted to put out something with them. ",Germany
" Your set up is mostly hardware based. Which gear was important when writing the album  Usually we use about 90  of hardware in our live sessions. We use Ableton to run the Midi Clock and for other sounds. We like the interaction with the gear to work. To be honest though Ableton headphones and some VSTs were key in the creation of the album. We traveled a lot last year before taking off the time to work on the the album. We had some ideas and made some sketches during our travels on Europe and America so every free moment in airports on trains in buses and hotels was essential for the conception of the album. At home we used some gear like Roland synths and drum machines NYX by Dreadbox and did the vocals with pedals arrangements and that s it. The rest is history. ",Germany
" The track Apache  came out on the recently launched Creatures Of The Night. What motivated you to start your own label and what is the philosophy behind it  We were thinking about starting a label for years. Last year we tried to do it but had many gigs and tours around the world and were working on the album so it was impossible. We didn t have the time until now so we decided to start with some classic Zombies In Miami tracks which haven t been released via Bandcamp yet like Apache  and Mission 504.  In the meantime we will properly start the label with one full Zombies in Miami EP that comes with a surprise remix. The release is ready now. The first   and our favourite   track is called Horizon.  It should be out on vinyl hopefully this year. We were motivated to do this because we have a lot of unreleased stuff and we wanted to put it out whenever we feel like it and also support Mexican artists who don t have the chance to reach big labels. For sure we will also have international friends involved on the project. We can say that we have releases upcoming by artists like Joseeph and Bad Name Roy from Mexico. We also want to make this label about gender equality so we are in the process to discover more talented people from home. ",Germany
" You are also active as a live act under the name Planet ZIM. What sets this project apart from the music you make under the Zombies In Miami moniker  We as producers like so many genres like techno reggae etc . In the studio we sometimes were having fun jamming with our hardware and some of it we liked it a lot. We had a gig request from the Goethe Institut in Mexico to play a special event with Dasha Rush and Kangding Ray so we decided to play a special live set as a surprise. Planet ZIM draws on techno and is very different from the classic Zombies in Miami sound. It was difficult for us to decide if we wanted to do it as Zombies in Miami or if it made more sense to start a different project so we decided to create a new project together. Some event promoters invited us to play as Planet ZIM. We have only one release under this name in the Common Sense compilation with great artist like DJ Nobu Peter Van Hoesen Juan Sanchez and more. We have more material that we will release later this year. We would love to play with this project in Europe some time  ",Germany
" Apart from playing live you have only recently started to DJ as a duo more frequently. What made you take this step and how do you approach DJing together as opposed to playing solo sets  We wanted to explore a different way to play shows at clubs since the last half of 2019. Of course we love to play as a live act more than anything else because it s our music and the people know us doing this. Also we had some issues in some clubs with the rider and it was almost impossible to fit all the gear in the booth and play live so we ended up playing DJ sets. After this we talked about it and decided to offer both options. Both of us have different tastes in music but we can play together very well. Also both of us have solo gigs playing live or DJ sets with our different solo projects. ",Germany
" What was the idea behind your contribution to our Groove podcast  The idea behind this mix is to share music by our Mexican and international friends of course some new unreleased Zombies in Miami tracks and stuff from the album. The sound ranges from house and disco sounds to spanish electro like Aun No  breaks or trance by Kim Ann Foxman and our Be Free  track for example. This is the kind of sound in our sets usually. We love to combine and explore different sounds quite similar like our live act. ",Germany
" Last but not least  what are your plans for the future  All our plans are paused by the moment due to the situation we are waiting to see the light after the storm. We have many plans like rescheduling our cancelled gigs in Asia and Australia Europe and all those events were planned for our album tour. Also the album will be out in September and we can t wait to have it in our hands. As we said our first vinyl record through our label should be out after this and Cani will start another label with Young Drums under the name Haunted Space Records. Jenouise is also working in her solo debut EP and Cani on his solo EBM and dark wave project Haunted Strasse. ",Germany

The clouds hang low all day thus during the tours we worried when it starts to rain. But the deity of weather was on our side  Probably you might be aware that it is the rainy season in most part of Japan right now and we ve been having humid weather. Does this sound depressing  That makes sense. But let me share you some enjoyments during rainy season. The early summer rainy season is called tsuyu and written with kanji characters meaning plum rain. Because it is the when plum trees bear fruit. Water plants produces beautiful flowers such as irises and water lilies. Fireflies can be added to the attractiveness of this season. They can be found flying about at night near the clean water s edge while emitting light from their lower abdomens. The myriads of tiny blinking lights creates fantastic atmosphere.

The weather was terrible so it was not a very comfortable tour for all of us. We really appreciated our guests  patience on that day. Actually June is a rainy season in Japan. The phrase June Bride  does not match with Japanese climate. June is not popular wedding month in Japan. In that sense the guests experienced a very typical June weather although it was not desirable for outdoor guide tour. It is recommended to enjoy indoor tours in such season. Where in Japan is best for indoor tour  How about Todai ji Temple in Nara prefecture  It is a big hall and you can view middle age made Buddha statues inside. If you are interested in Buddhism that is the place where you can spend an hour inside. Another big hall is Higashi Honganji temple in Kyoto. There is the world s biggest wooden made building.

" Trace of Hollyhock Crest May Date to Ieyasu s Construction on Nijo Castle ",Japan
" Uncovered by Typhoon Kyoto ",Japan
" Photo  The trace of the Hollyhock crest decoration that was revealed after an ornamental metal fitting was detached by a typhoon. A staff member is checking the trace by marking it with chalk  afternoon September 23 Nijo Castle Nakagyo Ward Kyoto  ",Japan
" A trace of a hollyhock crest decoration has been discovered on the roof of the National Treasure Ninomaru Palace in Nijo Castle Nakagyo Ward Kyoto as of September 26. The crest is associated with Ieyasu Tokugawa the first shogun of the Edo Shogunate who built the castle. This was an unexpected disclosure as the violent storm of Typhoon No. 21 also named Typhoon Jebi which hit the region on September 4 stripped off an ornamental metal fitting that had covered the trace since the Meiji Era when the castle became an imperial villa. ",Japan
" Photo  The roof of Ninomaru Palace where the hollyhock crest decoration trace was found ",Japan
" The crest of hollyhock leaves was found on the bargeboard of the southern gable of the Ninomaru Palace. It is 64 centimeters in diameter. It seems that a wooden plate or copper plate with the crest carved on it was installed. When the castle s staff members checked the damage after the typhoon they detected a trace of the crest standing out on the bargeboard from which the ornamental metal fitting was detached. ",Japan
" Nijo Castle has a deep connection to the Tokugawa family. It was completed by Ieyasu in 1603 and it was at that castle where Yoshinobu the 15th shogun declared the restoration of imperial rule in 1867. It was used as an imperial villa called Nijo Imperial Villa from 1884 to 1939 when the castle was transferred to Kyoto City. ",Japan
" The current ornamental metal fittings were installed to replace hollyhock crests which were removed when the castle was used as an imperial villa. At the Karamon Gate and other locations in the castle it has been discovered that several imperial chrysanthemum crests were placed to cover up hollyhock crests. ",Japan
" Following an on the spot investigation Tamaki Goto a manager in the Nijo Castle office said The Ninomaru Palace has never been destroyed by fire or other causes. It is possible that the hollyhock crest whose trace was discovered this time could date back to the time of construction by Ieyasu and that it was originally gilded. We would like to conduct further investigation including the status of other metal fittings and hollyhock crests. ",Japan

" Snow has been the backdrop to some of Tokyo s most colorful and epoch making events. ",Japan
" When pro emperor anti foreigner activists assassinated the shogun s chief councilor Ii Naosuke outside the Sakurada Gate of Edo Castle  today s Imperial Palace  on March 3 1860 the blood that stained that day s unseasonably heavy snow signaled the death knell of the Tokugawa Shogunate. ",Japan
" When some 1500 young Imperial Japanese Army officers seeking a true Imperial restoration seized the nation s capital in an attempted coup d etat on Feb. 26 1936 Tokyo was again blanketed with snow. The coup collapsed three days later but the incident became a major turning point that eventually spurred the rise of fascism in Japan. ",Japan
" Three hundred years ago   on Dec. 14 1702   the capital was also white with snow. That night a killing occurred that has been emblematic of the essence of the samurai  ever since. To this day it is embedded deep in the Japanese psyche. ",Japan
" The event has become Japan s most famous vendetta. Known as Chushingura  literally The Treasury of Loyal Retainers  after a kabuki play on which it is based it is the story of 47 ronin  masterless samurai  who beheaded a high ranking shogunate official they held responsible for the death of their lord two years earlier. As punishment the Tokugawa Shogunate ordered the ronin to commit ritual seppuku making it the most sensational incident in the Genroku Era  1688 1704  one of the most peaceful times in the Edo Period  1603 1867 . ",Japan
" Though the story has been depicted in joruri  ballad dramas with shamisen accompaniment  kabuki and movies and told in countless books the allure of the values it embodies has never faded. ",Japan
" The Chushingura chain of events began March 14 1701 when Asano Naganori the young daimyo of the Ako domain in Harima  present day western Hyogo Prefecture  drew his sword and attacked court chamberlain Kira Yoshinaka inside Edo Castle. They had been preparing for the ceremonies to receive an Imperial mission from Kyoto later that day. Although Kira suffered serious head and back injuries he survived the attack. ",Japan
" Infuriated the Fifth Tokugawa Shogun Tsunayoshi ordered Asano to disembowel himself immediately as such assaults were strictly banned inside the castle. Lord Asano was taken into custody at the residence of his fellow Lord Tamura Ukyodayu in Shinbashi where he dutifully committed seppuku later that day. ",Japan
" With its lord s death the Ako clan was cast to the winds leaving all of its several hundred vassals without a livelihood. In accordance with its rules the shogunate also took control of Ako Castle and the clan s Edo residence  on the current site of St. Luke s College of Nursing in Tsukiji . ",Japan
" To this day however it remains unclear what caused Lord Asano to act so violently though one theory has it that the brash 34 year old daimyo from the country was unfamiliar with Edo protocol and was repeatedly humiliated by Kira a refined 60 year old noble. ",Japan
" Whatever the cause the result split the Ako clan s former vassals into two factions. While one group wanted to petition the shogunate and install Lord Asano s younger brother as head of the domain the other comprised radicals eager to take revenge on Kira. In the eyes of both the masterless vassals and the public however the shogunate s decision to order only Lord Asano to commit suicide was arbitrary and partial since the established practice was to punish both parties in a quarrel. It is said that the decision was largely influenced by Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu a close aide of the shogun who had a firm grip on power behind the scenes. Yanagisawa had cozy ties with Kira the shogunate s most experienced officer in charge of Imperial relations. As a result most believed virtually no action was taken against Kira. ",Japan
" In fact the courtier s only punishment  was his own voluntary retirement. He relocated his residence near Edo Castle to a new one he had built on an 8500 sq. meter lot in Honjo Matsuzaka near Ryogoku. It is said his move came after pressure from his neighbors in the daimyo mansion district outside the castle as they feared Ako ronin might raid his residence and they could become involved in trouble. ",Japan
" When the shogunate denied the Ako clan the right to rebuild public sentiment in Edo swung even more toward the ronin   although no one publicly supported them for fear of the authorities and their spies. In fact Tokugawa Tsunayoshi the shogun at the time is viewed as the most fearful of all the Edo Period s 15 rulers for the severity of the laws he introduced. ",Japan
" Nonetheless the Genroku Era was a time when popular culture bloomed. It saw haiku poet Matsuo Basho spreading his art of words  joruri and kabuki scriptwriter Chikamatsu Monzaemon becoming Japan s answer to Shakespeare  Hishikawa Moronobu creating the style of ukiyo e  and multitalented Ogata Korin introducing original forms of art in painting pottery and textile dyeing. ",Japan
" It was also a time of prosperity. Commoners enjoyed life on tatami mats and people started taking three meals a day sometimes even eating out at outdoor stalls selling soba and snacks. Life was even better for wealthy merchants such as Kinokuniya Bunzaemon and Naraya Monaemon who both made their fortunes in the logging business and spent their money very publicly. ",Japan
" For the nonproductive class of samurai there was little to do at this time. The shogunate system was firmly in command and there had been no major upheaval in the political capital for decades to give them a raison d etre   until Lord Asano s 47 former vassals exacted their revenge in 1702. ",Japan
" In their willingness to die for their master the ronin exhibited the true spirit of samurai living in accordance with the Bushido. Developed during the Edo Period as a code of ethics unique to the samurai class the Bushido required a samurai to live with decorum and without taint and to cultivate his fortitude and manliness. Above all a samurai was loyal and obedient to his master. ",Japan
" Though most samurai even vassals of the shogunate itself were far from well paid commoners accorded them high status. Wealthy merchants would even offer their daughters  hands in marriage to those living true to the spirit of Bushido. Indeed honorable poverty was regarded as a noble state. The contemporary saying bushi wa kuwanedo takayoji  illustrates this  A bushi should pretend he has just finished a meal by having a toothpick in the corner of his mouth rather than have others think he is hungry. ",Japan
" The 47 ronin exemplified this spirit. Led by former chief retainer Oishi Kuranosuke they spent many months singlemindedly gathering information on Kira especially his new mansion which had been converted into a mazelike fort. Disguised as doctors merchants and other professionals they repeatedly met in Kyoto Edo and other locations to exchange tips. ",Japan
" Finally on the night of Dec. 14  on the lunar calendar then in use  Jan. 30 1703 on the Western calendar  as Edo was still blanketed with unthawed snow from the day before they met at one of their hideouts in Honjo near the Kira residence. ",Japan
" Clad in black coats resembling those of firefighters with white cloth bands sewn around their sleeves to avoid friendly fire in the dark the ronin proceeded to Kira s residence. ",Japan
" Once there they sent a messenger to Tsuchiya Chikara the master of the neighboring mansion notifying him they were about to storm Kira s residence and avenge their lord and asking him not to interfere. Such was the support for the spirit of their mission that he readily agreed. ",Japan
" With that detail attended to the ronin split into two groups   one entering Kira s front gate the other from the rear. After two hours of fighting the ronin achieved their goal before dawn. As Kira s retainers were caught off guard no ronin were killed in the attack  whereas they slayed 17 of Kira s men and wounded 28. ",Japan
" From Kira s house Oishi s squad went to Sengakuji Temple near Shinagawa where their master was enshrined and offered Kira s head. But on the way to the temple Terasaka Kichiemon a low ranking foot soldier left the company for a reason no one now knows for sure. One theory holds that he was given a secret mission to report to Lord Asano s widow Yozen in who was leading a monastic life that her husband had been avenged. Another has it that he was merely scared after the raid and fled. ",Japan
" After paying homage at Sengakuji the remaining 46 ronin turned themselves over in an orderly manner to shogunate authorities. The news immediately spread throughout Edo  the public and the samurai class alike including Shogun Tsunayoshi praised their prowess and their loyalty to their lord. ",Japan
" Only 12 days after the incident the first play based on the story of the Ako ronin was performed in Edo under the title Akebono Soga no Youchi  The Night Attack at Dawn of the Sogas .  Three days later it was banned by the shogunate for fear that subversive activities might spread. The story however was too potent and it would soon be re enacted again in joruri kabuki and other dramatic forms   with subtle alterations of the characters  names. ",Japan
" Public support for the ronin s cause was strong and even the shogun was sympathetic but ultimately the shogunate had to display its control over the justice system. Until a verdict was decided the ronin were placed under house arrest at four daimyo mansions outside the castle  14 ronin including Oishi with Hosokawa Tsunatoshi of the Kumamoto domain  10 with Matsudaira Sadanao of the Matsuyama domain  10 with Mori Tsunamoto of the Choshu domain  and nine with Mizuno Tadayuki of the Okazaki domain. ",Japan
" After cautious deliberations by senior shogunal officials they concluded that the raid could be interpreted as an act of righteousness    but fatally one that stemmed from a private cause  because the ronin took revenge without having the necessary shogunal approval to do so. Thus they ruled that the ronin would be ordered to commit seppuku   the utmost courtesy for a samurai s last hurrah. ",Japan
" On Feb. 4 1703 the 46 ronin simultaneously ended their lives at the mansions where they had been accommodated. Oishi was 45 while his son Chikara was the youngest among them at 16. The oldest ronin was Horibe Yahei a retired former Edo assigned vassal at 77. Their bodies were soon enshrined next to Lord Asano s grave at Sengakuji. ",Japan
" For three centuries since the popularity of Chushingura has never waned. Right after the incident Tsuchiya Kira s neighbor testified to shogunate officials that he had been impressed by the ronin whom he described as orderly and perfectly organized. ",Japan
" There is however another admirable aspect of the behavior of the Ako ronin  They showed isagiyosa which can be interpreted as grace with pride.  The attack was carefully planned certainly no spur of the moment event and the ronin all knew they faced death. When their time to die did come they did so gracefully with pride   as samurai. ",Japan
" Although the world has changed and a story like that of the Ako ronin could never occur in the 21st century the spirit of samurai and their isagiyosa is still admired by today s Japanese. Indeed it seems all the more impressive to a public sickened by the cowardly ways of its country s political business and bureaucratic leaders. Nonetheless as long as their sense of valor and loyalty remain in the Japanese psyche the popularity of Chushingura will never melt like winter s snow. ",Japan
" Condemned but  free from taint  ",Japan
" The final verdict on the 46 Ako ronin was largely influenced by Ogyu Sorai the most respected philosopher of the time even though many shogunal officials and Confucianists were rather sympathetic to them. Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi ordered the ronin to commit ritual seppuku based on Sorai s logic. The following are excerpts from Sorai s opinion translated by Donald Keene in his book Chushingura   Charles E. Tuttle Co.   ",Japan
" By righteousness we mean the path of keeping oneself free from any taint and by law we mean the measuring rod for the entire country. ",Japan
" A man controls his heart with decorum and his actions with righteousness. ",Japan
" For the 46 samurai to have avenged their master on this occasion shows that they are aware of shame as becomes men who are samurai  and since they have followed the path of keeping themselves free from taint their deed is righteous. ",Japan
" However this deed is ap propriate only to their particular group  it amounts therefore to a special exception to the rules. ",Japan
" The persons connected with the vendetta considered Kira to be their enemy because Asano Naganori was punished for his disorderly behavior in  Edo Castle  and they deliberately planned an act of violence without official permission. This is not to be tolerated under the law. ",Japan
" If the 46 samurai are pronounced guilty and con demned to commit seppuku in keeping with the traditions of the samurai the claim of the Uesugi family  Kira s wife s family which was one of the most powerful clans at the time  will be satisfied and the loyalty of the men will not have been disparaged. ",Japan
" This must therefore be considered as a general principle. If general principles are impaired by special exceptions there will no longer be any respect for the law in this country. ",Japan
" TV Tokyo and its network stations nationwide will air a 10 hour drama on Chushingura starting at 2 p.m. on Jan. 2 as its new year showcase program. Featuring one of the leading kabuki actors Nakamura Kichiemon as Oishi Kuranosuke Chushingura  Ketsudan no Toki  Time for Decision   adopts the framework of Kanadehon Chushingura  which was first performed in 1748 and is still a popular kabuki production.

" Fabio Rambelli Sato Hiroo Jason A. Josephson Storm Ioannis Gaitanidis Ellen Van Goethem Carina Roth Andrea De Antoni Rebecca Suter Mauro Arrighi Jolyon Baraka Thomas Andrea Castiglioni  Animated City  Life Force Guardians and Contemporary Architecture in Kyoto Bloomsbury Publishing 2019.04 Like practitioners of many other occupations architects are often asked to justify the meaning behind their creations or are required to envelop their proposals in appealing narratives to attract clients to promote their projects or to convince neighbors city authorities and competition jurors. In this chapter I explore the long held conviction that Kyoto is a city animated by various invisible agencies and how this notion has influenced its architecture between the 1990s and the early 2000s. Inspired by the belief that the city was designed and built in the late eighth century according to the core principles of site divination  popularly known as geomancy or fengshui     Ch. f ng shu  Jp. f sui    it is generally assumed that Kyoto is vitalized by the invisible flow of qi  Ch. q    Jp. ki   life force  or cosmic breath   and protected by the guardians of the four directions. Starting in the 1990s when a fengshui boom gripped Japan several architectural projects in Kyoto were conceived announced or justified with explicit reference to these practices either because of the architect s personal beliefs a particular client s request or to convince the general public of the project s suitability to the city. Be it implicitly or explicitly from the outset or post hoc fengshui derived concepts informed  at least in part and for different reasons  the design of the architectural projects discussed here. Moreover it will become clear that the three architects behind the projects Hara Hiroshi     Isozaki Arata     and Umebayashi Katsu     each differ in their level of commitment to fengshui ranging from a near total immersion to a more casual engagement with and isolated application of its principles..

" Ellen Van Goethem The Four Directional Animals in East Asia  A Comparative Analysis Asien  und Afrika Studien der Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin 38 201 216 2011.11 In this paper  I present some tentative conclusions about the comparative research I have been conducting into the way s  in which the four creatures that each guard one of the  cardinal  directions are represented in the physical landscape within the practice s  of geophysical divination. In China in Korea as well as in Japan these four directional beasts are identified as the Black Turtle Snake      of the back north  the Vermilion Bird      of the front south the Azure Dragon      of the left east and the White Tiger      of the right west. However the earliest texts on divination remain vague about the specific landscape features corresponding to each of the four mythical animals. In later times at least two co existing traditions seem to have developed within the practice of site divination in East Asia. Following one tradition emphasis lay on the presence of natural features with all four animals represented in the landscape as mountains. Another tradition however required the presence of a different natural or man made landscape feature for each of the four beasts. This paper focuses on the latter tradition in Japanese referred to as shijin s          correspondence to the four deities  . Through an investigation of written sources this paper will trace the origin and evolution of the observances of shijin s   as well as provide a basic analysis of the different textual traditions. Furthermore this paper will challenge the commonly held view that the practice of shijin s   was a divination process used to determine the location of capital cities.. ",Japan

Emphasis is placed on Heian Jingu the youngest yet most important shrine in the configuration. Constructed in the late nineteenth century to commemorate the 1100th anniversary of Kyoto s founding the shrine itself is replete with references to the four guardian deities of the cardinal directions and therefore also provides an interesting case study of the establishment of a shrine of national importance in the climate of shinbutsu bunri and the process in which the entire shrine set up from the actual buildings and decorations to the rituals and the shrine priests was created..

" VAN GOETHEM ELLEN Animated City  Life Force Guardians and Contemporary Architecture in Kyoto Invisible Empire  Spirits and Animism in Contemporary Japan 2017.02 In this presentation I explore the conviction that Kyoto is a city animated by a number of invisible agencies and how this notion has influenced the city s contemporary architecture. Inspired by the belief that the city was designed and built according to the core principles of site divination  popularly known as fengshui or f sui  it is generally assumed that Kyoto is vitalized by the invisible flow of qi and protected by the guardians of the four directions. Starting in the 1990s when a fengshui boom gripped Japan a number of architectural projects in Kyoto were conceived with explicit reference to fengshui either because of the architect s personal beliefs a particular client s request or to convince the general public of the project s suitability to the city..

" Ellen E. M. A. Van Goethem Of Trees and Beasts  Site Selection in Premodern East Asia The Third Conference of East Asian Environmental History  EAEH  2015.10  URL  Since ancient times people in the Chinese cultural sphere have been looking for ideal sites to construct graves found cities build houses etc. These practices are generally grouped under the broad label of telluric divination or geomancy  Chn.    fengshui . This paper focuses on a subcategory within telluric divination  it concentrates on a practice that received its own label shijin s        or correspondence to the four deities  in Japan but is in no way unique to the country. In China Korea and Japan a number of written sources dating from the 8th through 19th centuries describe the ideal siting conditions of private residences. What these sources have in common is that a residence needs to be surrounded by specific landscape features either natural or manmade  a river an irrigated plain a road and a hill  each corresponding to one of the four directional deities  the Azure Dragon the Vermilion Bird the White Tiger and the Black Turtle Snake . Inhabitants of a site that corresponds to these topographical requirements are promised good health and a long life a successful career and numerous descendants. Interestingly several of the written sources describing these ideal siting conditions also provide a practical and in most cases realizable solution to remedy any shortcomings in the surrounding topography in the form of substituting missing landscape features with specific  numbers of  trees. This paper will thus compare and contrast a number of these sources to address the underlying philosophy of substituting landscape features for trees as well as issues of knowledge transfer..

" Ellen E. M. A. Van Goethem Foreign Beliefs in  Native  Settings  Fengshui Elements in Shinto Shrines ICAS  International Convention of Asia Scholars  2015.07 The earliest evidence of the presence of fengshui related practices on the Japanese archipelago dates back to nearly two millennia ago. At that time there was no unified systematized or institutionalized indigenous religion. The loose set of native rituals and practices performed at the time is classified by scholars as kami worship and over the centuries that followed it was receptive of a wide variety of rites symbolism and beliefs belonging to imported religious traditions including Buddhism Confucianism and Christianity. This process of absorption did not come to a halt when kami related worship was systematized into what we now call Shinto. Close inspection of Shinto prayers and rites conducted at shrines reveals the pervasive influence of imported elements in this so called native religion. To illustrate this point this paper focuses on the famous Daizaifu Tenmangu shrine in Kyushu. Dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane  845 903  who was deified after his death and is still worshipped as a paragon of refinement and scholarship the shrine draws thousands of visitors and has been designated an Important Cultural Property. The shrine is thus portrayed as a symbol of Japan eseness  and its native religion. Scratching the surface however it quickly becomes clear that the core of the shrine s most important ritual the rice planting festival and the norito  ritual prayers  recited at the Dazaifu Tenmangu shrine are replete with fengshui related references..

Van Goethem Fengshui Protection  The Four Mythical Beasts and Shinto Shrines                             2015.06 This paper presents a discussion of the appearance and context of fengshui related symbolism in Japan. Attention will be focused on the four directional deities      and their associated symbolism from their initial appearance on the Japanese archipelago until the present day in an attempt to show how this symbolism became fully assimilated to the point that it appeared in  early  modern times in contexts no longer consciously associated with their original  practices or was fully absorbed into contexts that are deemed quintessentially Japanese. To illustrate this point this paper will present a case study of six well known Shinto shrines Dazaifu Tenmang  in Dazaifu and Heian Jing  Kamigamo jinja Matsuo taisha Yasaka jinja and J nang  in Kyoto. By doing so this paper will argue that the four directional animals preserved their ancient Chinese role of multivalent signs  susceptible to many applications interpretations meanings and values. As symbols i.e. visual depictions of underlying concepts the four divine beasts adapted to  or better still were appropriated by  changing circumstances and new ideas to appear in new and entirely different contexts..

Excavations of sites mostly related to local or central government facilities elite residences and temples have yielded hundreds of thousands of inscribed tablets or shavings  kezurikuzu .

" Ellen E. M. A. Van Goethem Adopting and adapting the paradigm  Gridiron cities in Japan International Institute for Asian Studies 2013.11  URL  Using the example of capital cities this paper will address the issue of cultural borrowing and the subsequent modification of imported ideas in ancient Japan. It is common knowledge that during the early centuries CE the ruling elites of the Japanese archipelago were heavily dependent on Chinese archetypes and prototypes for the formation of the early state. Unquestionably one of the most visually striking and impressive examples of this process of cultural borrowing was the establishment of large semi permanent urban centers. Laid out on a gridiron pattern with a clearly delineated space reserved for the ruler s residential quarters as well as for the apparatus of government itself also mostly newly introduced these cities symbolized the power of the ruler and the political social and cultural center of the recently emerged state. In order to explain how the Chinese archetype was adopted and adapted this paper will briefly trace the evolution of gridiron cities. Then it will address the process of selecting a suitable site for the establishment of these cities. This process is commonly addressed only briefly by referring to lofty ideals and or to esoteric practices but has received little scholarly attention so far.. ",Japan

As a result the Japanese people were continuously brain washed by the dishonest history textbooks and getting reproduced in a great large number over the four eras of Meiji Taisho Showa and Heisei. The Japanese people were deeply addicted to such viewpoint that they are not even aware of the fact they have been poisoned. How dangerous it is  ",Japan
" 2  nbsp nbsp nbsp On the other hand the Chinese history books frankly told the truth of the Japanese history as a neighbor.  nbsp nbsp nbsp In China the authentic chronicles of its dynasties have been written continuously since the 2nd century B. C.  Shiji . As soon as one dynasty ceased to exist Chinese described the history of their previous dynasty. They are indeed a rare great recorder in the world.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Since the 1st century A.D.  Hanshu  those authentic history books continued to write about the neighboring country the state of Wa  i. e. the western part of the Japan archipelago.  nbsp nbsp nbspThe first example is the golden seal. It was written in a book that China s latter Han dynasty bestowed it on Wa in 57 A.D.. Actually the golden seal was unearthed in the Shika island at the Hakata bay on a northern coast in Kyushu. The second example is the report the Sui s mission. On the basis of the mission s report the Sui history book wrote about famous mountains in Kyushu. Special to note is a report saying there was Mt. Aso with its erupting fire rising up to the sky. Mt. Aso is a living volcano in Kumamoto Prefecture in Kyushu. The Sui history book of the 7th century also wrote about emperors of the rising sun. Therefore it seems clear that the capital of the Wa state was at Dazaifu of Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu.  nbsp nbsp nbsp By the way at Dazaifu there still exist such village section names as Shishinden  the Hall for state Ceremonies Dairi  the Imperial Palace   and Suzakumon  the Southern Gate to the Capital . These are the proofs that there were once places concerning emperors.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Furthermore the China s Tang dynasty had had close relations with Japan. It had two old and new history books. About Japan both of them wrote about Japan as Wa state centering in Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu before the end of the 7th century and as Nihon or Nippon state in Nara or Kyoto Prefecture in Kinki after the 8th century. The Tang dynasty having relations with Japan may never make any mistakes about the fundamental international facts. ",Japan

"  nbsp nbsp nbspThese are the sites of ancient fortress ruins called Kogoishi.  nbsp nbsp nbspAround the midslope of the mountains at the height between several hundreds and a thousand meters brick shaped stones cut from big stones were laid to build the bases of doubly made outer walls of mountain fortresses.  nbsp nbsp Without an exception a water gate was attached to them. It was a water supply facility for soldiers and people who stay in the mountain castle in case of enemy invasions.  nbsp nbsp nbspI believe that they are the ruins of military fortress made in preparation for the possible invasion of foreign enemies such as Kokuryo Shilla and Tanng s China.  nbsp nbsp nbspMeanwhile Japanese academics had thought that they were made in the period between the 6th and 7th centuries.  nbsp nbsp nbspHowever recent dendrochronology has revealed that in 70 to 80  cases the results of the conventional archeological chronology by pottery should go back for about 100 years.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Accordingly those Kogoishi ancient fortress ruins should go back to the 5th and 6th centuries.  nbsp nbsp nbspThen the question arises about who made those military fortresses. I think that the political power situated in the center of the surrounding fortresses did. This area is composed of Chikushi  Fukuoka Prefecture  and Hizen  Saga Prefecture . It is clear that the Emperor in Kinki  Nara and Kyoto  had nothing to do with them.  nbsp nbsp nbspThis fact is very obvious. But the government compiled history after Meiji closed its eyes and cut of the map from the textbooks.  nbsp nbsp nbspAs a matter of fact these military fortresses had been constructed before the big war. You may remember that the allied forces of Tang s China and Shilla won the sea battle of Hakusukinoe off Paekche in 662 or 663 A. D. against the allied forces of Wa and Paekche.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Nevertheless today s Japanese academics and all textbooks have propagandized since Meiji that Queen Suiko and Prince Shotoku of Kink in the first half of the 7th century were the central power of the Japan archipelago.  nbsp nbsp nbsp Therefore I dare say that they are completely dishonest.

" 4 nbsp nbsp nbsp During the Edo isolation period fanatic ultra nationalism was developed.

" Kites have been objects of interest and fascination to people throughout the world for at least 2000 years. Some people think that kites may have been invented even earlier suggesting that kites were being flown in China as long ago as 1000 BC. Unless new information comes to light we have no real way of determining when they were invented who invented them or even which country they were first used in. Kites are normally made from light and quite fragile materials and we have very few actual examples of kites that are more than two hundred years old. Unlike other artifacts such as pots and stone or metal tools almost everything used to make a kite could rot or be burnt. Archeologists find out much of what they know about a culture from sources such as rubbish tips. Kites would not last long in this sort of environment. As we don t have the actual kites we have to rely on traditions legends illustrations and documents to chart the historical development of kites. ",Japan
" It is currently thought that kites may have been independently invented in both China and Malaysia and that this new invention then spread through the rest of Asia from these two countries. There certainly is documentary evidence to suggest that kites were being flown in China as long ago as 200 BC. when a general in the Han dynasty is recorded as having used a kite as an instrument of war by using it as a method of determining the correct distance to dig a tunnel to enter a palace and end a siege. Other Chinese legends relate how kites were used to lift fireworks in order to terrify an opposing army and how they were used to lift observers before a battle. Other uses for kites in Asia included a novel way of fishing  also practised in New Zealand  scaring birds from crops as a way of lifting construction materials to the tops of buildings and as a toy. In some Asian countries the kite had considerable religious significance. In Korea newly born children had kites flown and released for them taking away any bad luck they had been born with. Kites were flown by farmers in Thailand at the time of the monsoon to ask the gods to make the monsoon winds blow long enough to prevent all the rain falling on their crops and flooding them. ",Japan
" Japanese legends describe how a thief attempted to steal golden scales from a statue of a dolphin on the roof of Nagoya Castle by using a kite to lift him over the walls and onto the roof without alerting the guards. His scheme failed and he and his family were put to death by being boiled in oil. Japan became an important focal point for kites because of its geographical location. They were brought to Japan from China by Buddhist missionaries in the seventh century. From here kites spread throughout the Pacific region carried by Japanese traders and explorers. ",Japan
" Kites were introduced to Europe by explorers returning from Asia. Marco Polo an Italian explorer who returned from China in 1295 wrote remarkably accurate accounts of the construction of kites as well as how they were flown. The first known reference to kite flying in Europe appears in a manuscript about military technology written in 1405. Another text written in 1430 describes how to make a kite from parchment and explains how to connect the flying line to different points on the kite in order for the kite to fly well in a variety of wind conditions. Two other books written in 1589 and 1634 both recommend using kites to lift fireworks at night. An illustration of the town of Middelburg Holland made in 1618 shows children flying kites of the diamond shape so common today. In Europe unlike Asia kites were regarded simply as harmless toys for children to play with. In the following few centuries that view was to change dramatically. ",Japan
" In eighteenth century Europe the kite showed its usefulness asa scientific instrument. In 1749 a Scottish meteorologist named Alexander Wilson used kites to lift thermometers to a height of 3000 feet to measure temperature variations at altitude. Three years later Benjamin Franklin used a kite to demonstrate that lightning was similar to the static electricity that scientists were experimenting with at the time. By flying a kite in an electrical storm he was able to observe sparks coming from a key he had suspended from the flying line. Until that time there had been no direct evidence that lightning was an electric current travelling from the ground to the storm cloud. Franklin s experiments led to the development of the lightning conductor and placed him so high in the regard of the French people that he was able to travel to France during the American war of independence and obtain financial and military aid for the Americans. ",Japan
" Sir George Cayley experimented with kites between 1799 and 1809 in the quest to develop a heavier than air flying machine capable of carrying a passenger. He was the first person to describe scientifically the problems that would have to be overcome before man would fly in such a machine. ",Japan
" From kites Cayley moved to gliders that incorporated two kite shaped wings. His experiments culminated in 1853 in a full sized glider that supported the weight of one of his servants on a flight that lasted perhaps 40 seconds  after the flight the coachman promptly resigned . Cayley had identified the separate properties of lift thrust and drag and made a number of prophetic suggestions about what he called aerial navigation. ",Japan
" By 1826 George Pocock had patented a four stringed kite used for pulling carriages. The four strings allowed the kite to be controlled so that the carriage it pulled behaved much like a sailboat and could even tack into the wind. The carriage apparently was capable of reaching speeds of 30 km h. ",Japan
" Through the latter half of the nineteenth century a number of people experimented with kites as a lifesaving device. It was anticipated that some of these would be carried on the ship and flown onto the lee shore if the ship was wrecked. Once the kite had been retrieved by people on the shore heavier lines could be drawn out by the kite s flying line until a cable strong enough to carry the weight of an adult could be passed from the ship to the shore and a rescue of the crew and passengers effected by a breeches buoy basically a seat suspended from a pulley that could be pulled along a supporting line. Whilst the idea is good there is no recorded rescue using these methods. ",Japan
" In 1833 a British meteorologist E. D. Archibold started using kites to lift anemometers to measure wind speed at various altitudes. Meteorological observatories around the world used kites to lift instruments thousands of feet into the air. This gave a great deal of information about the atmosphere and vastly improved the weather forecasting of the time. Kites were to continue in this role until the mid 1930s when aircraft and radiosonde balloons finally replaced them. In 1887 Archibold was the first person to take an aerial photograph from a kite an application that is still practised today. Kites have been used as a cheap alternative method of obtaining aerial photographs of archeological sites reefs and the remains of shipwrecks. A photograph taken from even a comparatively short distance above ground level can show details not readily apparent from the ground. ",Japan
" By the late nineteenth century kites were being seen as serious scientific instruments. Kites were seen as a good starting point in the development of powered heavier than air flying machines. Potential aeroplane builders were tackling the problems of powered flight in a more disciplined manner making small steps forward and discovering their new craft as they went along. Rather than trying to create a flying machine in one step the more careful experimenters worked on one problem at a time solving each small part of the puzzle and then and only then bringing all the parts together in an attempt to build a working aircraft. There were still many people who did not believe that it was possible for a heavier than air machine to fly amongst them being Professor Simon Newcomb  a well respected astronomer and in 1903 the only American since Benjamin Franklin to be made an Associate of the Institute of France  and Rear Admiral George Melville chief engineer for the United States Navy. Even after the Wright brothers had flown there were many people saying that powered flight was impossible. In hindsight it seems strange that such a world changing event was virtually ignored until several years after the fact. ",Japan
" Throughout Europe and America experiments were being undertaken to determine the best sort of design for powered aircraft. The Wright brothers were by no means the only people trying to build an aeroplane  they were simply the first to achieve powered and controllable flight. There were still many fanciful designs being touted as the solution to the problem of powered flight  human powered flapping wings built onto a bicycle being but one example  but in the main the advocates of powered flight were making gradual but definite progress towards overcoming the intricacies of lift thrust drag stability and control. Lawrence Hargrave experimented near Sydney in the 1890s with a number of kite designs. He finally settled upon what he called a cellular or box kite. He was looking for a stable lifting surface to which he could add an engine. His experiments led to the development of the cambered aerofoil a feature that generated much more lift than a flat surface. Put simply a curved wing surface causes the air traveling over the upper surface to move faster and travel further than the air passing along the lower surface of the wing. The air passing over the top surface has a slightly reduced pressure. The greater pressure below the wing exerts an upwards force called lift and within certain limits increases with airspeed. ",Japan
" Some of Hargrave s later gliding kites were so efficient that they flew at angles of up to 110 degrees. The kite could well be further into the wind than its tether point which caused a problem if the wind dropped. Hargrave solved this problem by flying this style of kite from a trapeze like structure which prevented the kite from reaching the ground if the wind did ease at all. ",Japan
" Most kites fly at angle of less than 50 degrees above the horizon. Efficient kites normally fly at angles of up to 70 degrees. The reason Hargrave s gliding kites flew so well was due to the shape of the wing he developed. It was shaped very much like the cross section of a modern aeroplane wing with a slight reflex curve at the trailing edge producing enough just enough drag to stop the kite falling forwards into the wind. ",Japan
" The cambered aerofoil is the basis of the shape of all aircraft wings today. In his quest for a light power source he also invented the rotary engine. Unfortunately he was unable to overcome the weight problems that beset so many of the early aviation pioneers and his dream of a full sized powered box kite never came to pass. In the course of his research he presented 23 papers and exhibitions to the Royal Society of New South Wales on aviation related topics. Hargrave was more interested in solving the problem of powered flight than in being the person to do it. He did not patent any of his inventions preferring their benefits to be available to all researchers into the development of the aeroplane. In Australia his achievements are acknowledged by a statue at Stanwell Park New South Wales where he carried out his experiments his likeness and some of his gliders may be seen on one side of our twenty dollar note and the engineering and science library at Monash University is named after him. Ironically the only museum Hargrave was able to pursuade to display his collection of revolutionary kites was in Berlin. His kites which had helped in the development of powered flight were destroyed in the bombing of Germany during the second world war. ",Japan
" The Wright brothers eventually overcame these weight problems and flew an aeroplane of their own design in 1903. This was the climax of several years of experimentation using kites and gliders. The wing warping system they used to control their aeroplane had been developed by flying their smaller versions as kites and twisting the wings with four lines from the ground. Because of their extensive flying of their designs as kites and their use of wind tunnels to test ideas about wings and propellers they were able to collect a great deal of information about the stability of their designs as well as the amount of lift the glider developed for a given wind. This gave them invaluable information about the necessary size and curvature for the wings of their 1903 flyer. ",Japan
" Alexander Graham Bell was also trying to invent the first powered aeroplane. He knew of the work being undertaken by Hargrave and he also experimented with kites to determine the most suitable lifting surface. He finally settled on a cellular kite made of regular tetrahedrons  the shape is best known now as that of the tetra pack that Sunny Boys and similar icy poles come in a pyramid with four triangular sides . ",Japan
" Later he and a number of like minded people set up an association with the express purpose of developing an aeroplane. This association included Tom Selfridge who later became the first person to die in an aeroplane when he and Wilbur Wright crashed whilst conducting trials for the United Stated Army and Glenn Curtis who later became one of the first aircraft manufacturers in America. Curtis later had to defend himself in court against the Wright brothers who claimed an exclusive patent on the aeroplane. ",Japan
" Kites were used as an observation device during both the first and second world wars. They were used as a means of increasing the range of visibility by German submarines during both of these wars. At water level an observer might be able to see 8 kilometers but by using a kite to lift that observer to a height of 400 feet visibility could be increased to 40 kilometers. When keeping a lookout for enemy ships such an increase of range was definitely an advantage. During the second world war kites were supplied as standard equipment in life rafts on British and Australian aircraft. If the raft had to be used the kite could be used to lift the antennae of an emergency radio transmitter. The kite was also used as an airborne sail  although the speed of the raft through the water was quite low it did help to stabilize the boat in rough seas. Kites with two control lines were developed by a U. S. Navy Commander during the second world war as a means of training naval antiaircraft gunners. Paul Garber s kite was highly manoeuvrable and was used in target practice. The kite was said to be quite hard to hit as it moved around the sky at the command of its pilot who was safely on the ground. Paul Garber had seen the Wright brothers demonstrate their aircraft to the US. Army in 1909 and later became the curator of the Smithsonian Institute which holds the largest collection of aviation related artifacts in the world. ",Japan
" Kites again attracted attention in the 1950s and 1960s when Francis Rogallo developed a completely flexible kite with no rigid supporting spars. Instead of spars this kite uses the wind itself to hold it open and maintain its shape. Rogallo was an aeronautical engineer working for NASA. He was searching for a controllable recovery system for spacecraft. This kite was the first to be developed with the assistance of wind tunnel testing and is an indication of how far kites have come since they were simply a child s toy. The Rogallo wing rather than being used just as a kite has been put to numerous uses by the American military and is the basis for hang gliders and through them for many of the ultralight aircraft designs being flown today. ",Japan
" Another recent and widely used kite is the parafoil. It too has no spars sticks or other form of rigid bracing. It is a true aerofoil using the force of the wind to inflate the kite and maintain its shape. Of all kite designs this style gives the greatest amount of lift known to date. This design has been developed into steerable parachutes and is the basis of the paraglider a non rigid hang glider. With the development of the parafoil the evolution of the kite has undergone a new twist. Rather than aeroplanes imitating the shape and form of kites as happened at the end of the last and the beginning of this century kites are now starting to imitate the form of the aeroplane. ",Japan
" Manoeuvrable kites. ",Japan
" Kites have undergone a resurgence of interest recently. This is due mainly to the development of sport kites. These kites use two lines rather than one and may be steered around the sky often at speeds in excess of 100 kilometers per hour. Kites have also been developed which use four lines allowing the user to alter the angle the kite presents to the wind and so control forward and backward motion of the kite. As wonderful as these kites are manoeuvrable kites are not new. They have been used for centuries in one form or another around the world. ",Japan
" The oldest form of manoeuvrable kite was developed in Asia and uses one string rather than two to control it. Traditionally this sort of kite is made from tissue paper and bamboo. It is thought that it originally developed in China and then spread throughout the rest of Asia carried by explorers and Buddhist monks. This kite is made of flexible materials and is manoeuvered by pulling in or releasing line. When the line is pulled in the kite bends at the wingtips and becomes stable. In its bowed state it will fly in a straight line. When line is released the kite becomes flat and unstable. It will then tumble or spin. When the kite is pointing in the direction the flier wants it to go line is pulled in bowing the kite again and causing it to fly in a straight line along its new course. The amount of control over a kite of this style depends upon the skills of the flier and competitions to see who has the most skill are very common in Asia. This competition takes the form of a fight. The flying line normally button thread has part of its length coated with a mixture of glue and powdered glass or pottery making the line extremely abrasive. During the fight both contestants attempt to manoeuver their kites around the flying line of their opposition and when this has been achieved a sawing motion is all that is needed to wear through their opponent s flying line. For this reason this style of kite is commonly called a fighting kite. ",Japan
" More general contests or festivals also take place especially in India. The largest and oldest kite festival in the world takes place in Ahmedabad on the 14th of January of every year. This festival is a free for all with perhaps 100 000 kites in the sky at once all trying to cut each other down. The festival has been celebrated for centuries at the time that the winter solstice has passed and the sun has again climbed above the constellation of Capricorn. The festival is called Makar Sankranti which means the conclusion of Capricorn. Tales of kite fighting are found in the Sanskrit religious writings of the Veda and in the epic the Ramayana. The importance of kites in India is suggested by the Hindi language which has more than 100 different words for kite. ",Japan
" Thailand Malaysia Japan and Korea also have their own kite fighting traditions as well as their own traditional kite designs. The fighting kites of Japan are normally rectangular or hexagonal and can be big enough to require teams of up to 50 men to control them. It has been suggested that fighting kites developed in Japan as a method of solving disputes between neighbouring villages as a sort of aerial trial by combat. The city of Nagasaki one of the only points of contacts between Japan and the early European explorers during the time that Japan maintained an isolationist policy has a traditional fighting kite called the Hata. It is very similar in shape to the Indian fighter and is traditionally painted in the red white and blue colour scheme of the Dutch flag and the English translation of Hata means flag. Because the tradition of flying this style of kite in Japan is only found around Nagasaki it is commonly thought that the kite derives from Indian fighters brought to Japan by Dutch explorers and merchants. ",Japan
" Multiple line kites aren t new in Europe either. By 1826 George Pocock had used 4 stringed kites to pull carriages through the English countryside. These flying lines were used to allow the kites to be manoeuvered like the sails of a boat and just like a sailboat his kite drawn vehicle could actually tack into the wind. Other kites using more than one line were developed later in the nineteenth century mainly as devices for carrying rescue equipment to shipwrecks but it wasn t until the Second World War that kites using two lines were flown in the manner we are accustomed to today. Paul Garber s Navy Target Kite could be controlled by means of a rudder attached to the back of the kite and was used to give gunners on ships practice against a moving target. By the end of the war over 300000 of the kites had been distributed amongst American military forces around the world. ",Japan
" In the 1960s a number of dual control kites came on to the market but it wasn t until 1972 when the Peter Powell Stunt Kite was released that stunt kites became really popular. This diamond shaped kite was relatively cheap was easy to fly and used an extremely long inflatable tail that allowed people to sign write with their kite. It originally used aluminium spars and a plastic sail but later models used fibreglass spars and a ripstop nylon sail for increased durability. This kite is still in production today and remains a very popular design. ",Japan
" Since the development of the Peter Powell kite there have been many other innovations. One style of kite that has developed is called the Flexifoil basically a kite shaped like an aeroplane wing. Although very similar in design to a parafoil it differs in that it has no fins or keels and instead has a spar running along the front edge of the kite to hold it open. This kite develops incredible amounts of lift and can fly in an arc across the wind at speeds well in excess of 160 kilometers per hour. As the speed of this kite increases so does the amount of lift. Large versions of this kite easily drag people across flying fields and a recent innovation has been to water ski behind this style of kite. ",Japan
" The most common style of stunt kite is based on the delta wing. Shaped like hang gliders these kites make use of materials initially developed by the aerospace industry for high performance aeroplanes and spacecraft. Materials such as kevlar and spectra have properties such as very low stretch factors and remarkable strength to diameter ratios. Kevlar is used in the production of bullet proof vests whilst spectra is used in the tethers astronauts use when they work outside their spacecraft. These materials are also used in the manufacture of flying lines for high performance kites. A flying line made of spectra no thicker than ordinary sewing thread has a breaking strain of over 50 kilograms and will stretch less than one percent of its length. A nylon line of similar breaking strain would be around six times as thick and would have a stretch factor of about twenty percent. The spars used in many high performance kites are made from carbon fibre a non metallic material developed for use in Stealth aircraft as it doesn t show up on radar. Many other uses have been found for these sorts of materials as they have become more readily available and costs have been reduced. ",Japan
" The most recent development in kites has been the reintroduction of kites with four lines. These quad line kites can be flown forwards backwards or sidewards and may even be made to hover. The space age materials are new but the idea isn t  the Wright brothers used four lines on the models they built to test their ideas about wing warping. The flier holds two handles with lines attached to the top and bottom of both of them. Twisting the handles forwards or backwards alters the angle of the kite and it is possible to use the whole kite as a sort of combination elevator and aileron and so alter the angle that one or both sides of the kite meets the wind. By pulling the top of the kite further into the wind the kite will fly forwards. Pulling the bottom of the kite further into the wind will cause the kite to fly backwards. If the bottom of one side of the kite is pulled into the wind the kite will turn in that direction as this side of the kite no longer generates as much lift. These kites are quite difficult to fly but do give the flier an exceptional opportunity to learn about how the angle of a kite in the wind affects its flight. ",Japan
" The popularity of dual control and quad line kites has had a marked influence on kites in general. Kites are more popular now than at any previous time in history. While the manoeuvrable kites have captured the imagination of many there are also many people who have discovered the beauty and peacefulness of single line flying. The materials that have been used for manouevrable kites are now being used for single line kites as well giving kite makers greater scope for creative endeavour. Their creations are becoming bigger and bigger and the general public is taking more notice of them. During 1992 and 1993 there were two exhibitions of kites made by leading artists and kite makers touring the world and kite festivals around the world are multiplying at an astonishing rate. As a sport or a hobby kites have much in their favour. They are cheap quite easy to make and most importantly kites can teach the maker much about the physical world. ",Japan

" Here are a few things to help you get oriented. ",Japan
" Kyoto is roughly flanked by mountains to the east and west. The Kamo River runs north south through the center of the city. Osaka is about 60 km to the south. ",Japan
" The city was built on a rectangular grid system. The main streets running east to west are numbered in ascending order from north to south and are roughly 500 meters apart from each other  with smaller streets in between . This means Ni Jyou  2nd Avenue  is north of San Jyo  Third Avenue  and San Jyou is north of Shi Jyou  Fourth Avenue . The main north south street is Karasuma dori  Karasuma Avenue  which runs from Kyoto Station through the city center to the Imperial Palace. ",Japan
" Kyoto was originally modeled after the Chinese Tang dynasty  618 907  capital Chang an  now Xian . At some early point the western half of Kyoto came to be called Choan jo  Chang an Castle  and the eastern half Rakuyo jo  Castle of Luoyang another early Chinese capital . However the western half of Kyoto was full of wetlands and soon became desolate and the name Choan jo gained only nominal usage. On the other hand the development of eastern Kyoto made Rakuyo synonymous with the capital and the abbreviation Raku came to mean Kyoto itself. During the 14th century the Imperial Palace the center of the capital also moved over to the east where the current Imperial Palace of Kyoto is located today.

When the wind abated they found to their astonishment that the coast ran northeast. The Indian Ocean lay open before them vast and uncharted.

" On the 27th day of the third moon  of the second year of Genroku   May 16 1689 314 years ago this week   Basho  a pen name deriving from the basho banana plant by his cottage  set forth from Edo  Tokyo  on his most famous journey   a five month trek north to Hiraizumi in present day Iwate Prefecture then southwest down the Sea of Japan coast to Ogaki near Lake Biwa. He was 45 a veteran of the road with four poetic travel narratives already behind him. Oku no hosomichi  Narrow Road to the Deep North   in 1694 became the fifth. ",Japan
" In the first The Record of a Weather Exposed Skeleton  he describes his wanderlust  Following the example of the ancient priest who is said to have traveled thousands of miles caring naught for his provisions and attaining the state of sheer ecstasy under the pure beams of the moon I left my broken house on the River Sumida in August  1684  among the wails of the autumn wind.  ",Japan
" We gather from the title that he was not robust and his poem as he prepares to depart   Determined to fall  A weather exposed skeleton . . .    suggests awful perhaps fatal rigors lying ahead. The anticipated harvest was poetry   not gold spices slaves knowledge trade routes heathens converted to Christianity or new lands won for his sovereign to reign over. Poetry  Sheer ecstasy under the pure beams of the moon.  ",Japan
" Basho surely never heard of Columbus and his new continent or of Vasco da Gama who sailed round Africa and landed in India in 1498 or of Ferdinand Magellan who circumnavigated the globe in 1520 21. Basho s world in physical terms was far far narrower than even the pre Columbian Western world. ",Japan
" China  was Basho s symbol for anything in it that was not Japan. He had never set eyes on China never would didn t want to. Had not Chinese and Japanese poets of old already captured its magnificence in verse  He left for the Deep North dreaming of the moon over Matsushima   nor did Matsushima disappoint him when he finally arrived  Matsushima is indeed the most beautiful place in all Japan  It can easily hold its own with Lake Tung ting and Lake Xi in China.  ",Japan
" China meant more than dream scenery to Columbus and he had every intention of setting eyes on it. He envisioned a fabulous empire of gold jewels spices inconceivable flora and fauna possibly even the legendary Christian king known as Prester John reportedly eager to unite with Western Christians against the infidel. China is where Columbus thought he was going when he sailed westward from Spain in August 1492  it s where he thought he was two months later when a Cuban Indian  made a reference to a local region called Cubanacan  and Columbus took him to mean El Gran Can    the Great Khan of Marco Polo s China. Thinking they were being escorted to the khan s palace Columbus and his men arrived instead at a village of 50 palm thatched huts whose awed inhabitants received them as messengers from the sky. Basho would have been charmed. ",Japan
" Basho s Cuba    his America    was Japan s far northern provinces.  That was as remote as a Japanese could legally venture in his day and for nearly two centuries to come. The country had been sealed shut 60 years earlier by order of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The policy was called sakoku   literally closed country.  Venturing overseas   or having ventured returning   was a capital offense. ",Japan
" Might that not cramp a wandering poet s style  Not Basho s. Far from straining at the bit far from lusting for the great wide world from which his country s laws barred him Basho paused at the Tokugawa shrine at Nikko on his way north to pay fulsome homage to the most sacred of all shrines  whose  benevolent power prevails throughout the land embracing the entire people like the bright beams of the sun.  ",Japan
" Politics aside freedom is Basho s theme embodied in his very trajectory. Heading north writes Basho translator Nobuyuki Yuasa meant avoiding the familiar Tokaido route.  In the imagination of the people at least the North was largely unexplored and it represented for Basho all the mystery there was in the universe. ",Japan
" Symbolic gateway to this mystery  was the Shirakawa Barrier 180 km north of Edo in present day Fukushima Prefecture. An ancient defense against northern barbarians it was a mere ruin in Basho s day but as an utamakura a place with poetic associations it was very much alive. Had I a messenger I would send a missive to the capital   wrote the poet Taira Kanemori at Shirakawa in the 10th century by which time the barrier was already in disuse. The suggestion is of hopeless remoteness   but Basho unlike Kanemori was not ending his journey here. He was beginning it. ",Japan
" The West had its own version of sakoku. Scholars call it the Great Interruption    a 1000 year attempt reinforced by all the supernatural terrors of the primitive Christian imagination to squeeze the world into a shape consistent with Holy Writ. Jerusalem was the navel of the world.  Six parts hast thou dried up  declared the apocryphal Book of Esdras   six parts of seven that is  oceans hardly came into the picture at all. When they did they led to the void or to Paradise. ",Japan
" St. Brendan  484 578  sailed westward from Ireland to Paradise. So he said on his return and he was believed. His sacred island  writes historian Daniel Boorstin remained plainly marked on maps for more than 1000 years at least until 1759.  Christopher Columbus the discoverer of America made four voyages to his new continent without realizing that it was one. He thought it was Asia. But the puzzles and inconsistencies multiplied. His journals show him suspecting the truth  I believe this is a very great continent until today unknown   then veering away from it  I am convinced it is the spot of the earthly paradise wither no one can go but by God s permission . . .  The great discoverer died in 1506 unenlightened by his discoveries. ",Japan
" By Basho s time of course most of the confusion had been sorted out. America was settled and thriving  the institutions and the thinking that were to produce the American Revolution were well under way. Europe s fleets plied the oceans its commerce spanned the globe. Even closed Cipangu had given the Dutch a foothold at Nagasaki. The new world vast beyond medieval imaginings was slowly growing familiar. ",Japan
" Basho meanwhile plodded north. A famous contemporary portrait shows him in priestly garb leaning on a stick his feet shod in thin sandals his disciple Sora following behind. He traveled mostly on foot occasionally on horseback a prematurely elderly man feeble and frequently ill braving the rigors of the road in pursuit of the moon over Matsushima.  ",Japan
" Whatever such a mind sees is a flower  he had written earlier   such a mind  meaning a mind in harmony with nature   and whatever such a mind dreams of is the moon.  In Basho the stars pass almost unnoticed. ",Japan
" Did he know of the newly discovered shape and extent of the world  There is no indication he did or that he cared about such things. Other matters preoccupied him the smaller and quieter the better. ",Japan
" Born Matsuo Kinsaku in 1644 in the castle town of Ueno near Kyoto he studied poetry as a child and as a young man cast off his samurai status to enter a temple. He moved to Edo became a teacher of poetry grew increasingly restless with social and poetic conventions and drifted away from both moving into a quasi hermitage on the Sumida River and slowly over the years refining haiku from a facile social pastime into an art mirroring our everlasting self which is poetry.  ",Japan
" What is the matter you Christian men that you so greatly esteeme so little portion of gold more than your own quietnesse . . .  So the 16th century chronicler Peter Martyr records a young Indian reproaching a party of Spaniards quarreling over gold. A pity Basho never encountered these Indians. He would have liked them   and they him. Since I had nowhere permanent to stay  he wrote I had no interest whatever in keeping treasures and since I was empty handed I had no fear of being robbed on the way.  ",Japan

" MOTOBU OKINAWA PREF.   As Okinawa s Route 58 snakes northwards leaving behind the lines of silver razor wire that surround the perimeters of U.S. military bases the shabby ribbon of towns that form a kind of urban bricolage is replaced with farmland and salty breezes from the East China Sea. ",Japan
" Nago is the first settlement of consequence in this region of northern Okinawa. An appealingly laconic town with stained concrete buildings sun blistered wooden homes and little comestible stores it reminds me of the dusty towns along the Mekong River in northern Thailand. The improbable decision to choose Nago to host the Group of Eight summit in 2000 briefly put the area on the map. It has since dropped off. ",Japan
" My purpose for being here is to visit its city hall designed by a daring group of young architects who were also the founders in 1971 of a collective known as Team Zoo. The group was commissioned to create a building that departed from tradition in a town where in ancient times building styles were based on Chinese models. ",Japan
" Completed in 1981 the town hall reflects the region s languid semitropical environs with airy open corridors and staircases wide patios and shaded breezeways bedizened with pots of pink and magenta bougainvillea. The exterior columns a latticework of concrete pillars and supports are covered in bands of pink and gray like a barber s pole. The open design has shaped a building that does not despite its function seem in the least bit institutional. ",Japan
" Critic Patrice Goulet once commented that Team Zoo s projects though patently unconventional in drawing their ideas from the vernacular culture could appear so normal to some so traditional even   so vulgar to others.  Affectionately eccentric one might add like the 56 talismanic Okinawa shisa statues  lion esque guardians of Okinawa homes  that are tacked to the outside of the building perched on concrete plinths like gargoyles. ",Japan
" At the rear of Unten Port to the northeast of the peninsula Mumujana baka rarely appears on maps. Over half a millennium old   but unlisted as a heritage site   its tombs carved into the rock face and containing the remains of regents who once served the Ryukyu Kingdom have remained outside the mainstream of time. Neither Buddhist nor Shinto with ties closer to ancient forms of animism Okinawans have long practiced a polytheistic form of religion   largely presided over by female priestesses and shamans   that concerns itself more with ritual than complex cosmological musings. ",Japan
" Somebody had left a clutch of cane walking sticks at the entrance to the tombs placed there not to support the weary but to thwack the tropical growth on either side of the earthen path to send snakes slithering away. My experience of habu Okinawa s most venomous pit viper creatures that infest limestone cliffs like this is that they are not so easily intimidated. ",Japan
" Traditionally the floors of homes in this and other rural areas were cleansed with salt water a measure aimed at preventing snakes and cockroaches from entering. Luckily the only reptile I come across is the harmless Ryukyu kinobori tokage an alert green skinned Okinawa tree lizard. The region s ibo imori newt mountain turtles and the flightless rail keep themselves out of sight concealed in jungle camouflage though almost supernaturally large black and white  gomadara  tree nymph  butterflies flutter above the path. ",Japan
" Roads deeper into the peninsula rise into more forest one unsurfaced lane ending at the grassy forecourt of Ai Kaze an aizome  indigo dye  workshop whose name translates to Indigo Wind.  I had visited before and had been surprised to see textile maker Masanao Shiroma pour a bottle of awamori Okinawa s signature liquor into the dyeing vat a means it was explained to fasten the blue into the material before it is wind dried on a line outside. This repeat visit is spurred by the memory of its cafe where a strong local brew is served at handmade wooden tables and chairs on a deck that is cantilevered over the garden and surrounding forest. ",Japan
" Nearby Nakijin is an attractive village its midday torpor inductive to either eating or for those so inclined sleeping. Erected on an isolated eminence its northern parts facing the ocean and with a precipitous drop along its eastern edge into a gorge the site for Nakijin Castle was surely chosen not merely for its defensive features but also for drama. ",Japan
" The masonry here is cruder than the limestone work seen in castles in southern Okinawa but the site lines that now constitute its main walls and the remains of an ancient keep hint at well developed engineering skills. The foundations of residences used by retainers a garden area and fresh spring form a well managed enclosure. There are also visible traces of prayer sites once used by priestesses to conduct prayers and rituals. ",Japan
" Following Route 115 in a southerly direction connecting with Route 84 the main coastal road leads to what is without question the peninsula s main draw  the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium. Tanks and outdoor pools form a veritable marine kingdom of reef manta rays  flame snappers  graceful bull tiger and whale sharks  manatee  luminescent shrimp  and some of the most bizarre looking fish you will ever set eyes on. The whale sharks magnificent in their command of the water float in territorial splendor through the depths of the aquarium s humongous main tank whose acrylic front panel was once the largest in the world. ",Japan
" It s just a few minutes north from the aquarium to Bise a coastal village known for its sandy lanes lined with dense fukugi  evergreen  trees. Even on sunny days only filtered light makes it through the canopy of closely matted leaves  the trees are used throughout Okinawa as typhoon barriers. Snugly inside their arboreal quadrangles are traditional Okinawa houses crafted from stone tile and wood. Some 230 homes sit within an aural oasis where the buzz of cicadas rustle of leaves and the lap of the ocean are the sole sounds. ",Japan
" Few people visit the nearby village of Shinzato with its attractive but modest residencies and kitchen gardens. The evident lack of a center to the settlement made finding the new home of the highly regarded potter Paul Lorimer a trying business. When Lorimer who has lived in Okinawa for over 40 years went to view the property there was little to see the long abandoned structure covered in jungle vines. ",Japan
" Then his first task was to dig out a termite nest from one of the rooms. It s a very different residence today with polished floors antique cabinets a gallery where he exhibits his earthy stoneware jars vases plates incense burners and flagons and a long garden facing deck hand built like the brick kiln at the rear of the property by Lorimer himself. ",Japan
" Much of his work involves producing unglazed storage jars for awamori an Okinawa liquor made from indica rice imported from Thailand. A good deal of floor space in Lorimer s main room is taken up with rows of liquor casks and the native New Zealander turns out to be quite a specialist on the subject. ",Japan
" Intrigued by the reaction that takes place between aging awamori and the chemical elements of clay jars   such as manganese calcium and magnesium   and their effect on taste depth and aroma Lorimer has placed the liquor into containers of differing mineral characters in what is an ongoing experiment. Lorimer steers me through a range of older liquors to demonstrate the difference  Clay matured awamori in contrast to younger bottled varieties has the effect of mollifying and teasing the palate rather than biting into it. ",Japan
" Lorimer s lifestyle and work and the material environs he has created to compliment them suggest at least to the casual guest an earthly Utopia. How many of us spellbound by the transcendent naturalism that is a feature of Henry David Thoreau s book Walden  or poet Janet Frame s account of her stay in the once Elysium like Balearic Islands have dreamed of withdrawing to a rural idyll like this  Such are the thoughts occupying me as I drive back to my minshuku  guest house  reaching the west coast of the peninsula as twilight fades. ",Japan
" Darkness swallows up the sun but not the heat or the unholy downpour that soaks me to the skin. The clouds above are pierced by bolts of lightning and the ocean is lit up to phantasmagoric effect. As the thunder recedes the lashing rain turns to sputtering squalls. The storm is spent. ",Japan
" There are regular buses from Okinawa s Naha Bus Terminal to the city of Nago. The bus service around the Motobu Peninsula is patchy and buses infrequent. To fully experience the area it is better to rent a car or scooter. ",Japan
" In line with COVID 19 guidelines the government is strongly requesting that residents and visitors exercise caution if they choose to visit bars restaurants music venues and other public spaces. ",Japan

Ten years had passed since American Black Ships  steamed into Edo Bay   demanding trade brandishing ultimatums dictating treaties. The shogun signed. He opened ports to foreign trade exempted foreigners from Japanese law. Was this not treason  ",Japan
" Medieval shoguns centuries earlier had seized power from Japan s legitimate ruler the divine emperor. The gods had long contained their anger. Now at last they were stirring. Yamatodamashii  Japanese spirit  flared in righteous Japanese breasts. Traitors   living and dead   must be cut down. ",Japan
" The 14th century Toji Temple was founded by shogun Ashikaga Takauji  1305 58 . A brilliant warrior and vigorous ruler he charted a new course for Japan.

Noh drama tea ceremony deeper Zen wider trade with China the Temple of the Golden Pavilion the Temple of the Silver Pavilion   such in part is the Ashikaga legacy. ",Japan
" The nine swordsmen cared little for that. Other thoughts consumed them  Takauji s treacherous seizure of power from the emperor he d originally been enlisted to serve  his grandson Yoshimitsu s humiliating kowtowing to China for trade and the China conferred title King of Japan    wounds to the sacred body politic still throbbing half a millennium later in the souls of those who regarded themselves as the emperor s most fervent loyalists.

" The statues of Takauji Yoshimitsu  1358 1408  and Ashikaga Yoshiakira  1330 67  were of wood.

" But the Tokugawa shoguns  1603 1868  could not see to it. Russia Britain and the United States were expansionist powers hungry for trade if not conquest. Early exploratory incursions in the late 18th century exposed the weakness of Japan s coastal defenses. Barbarian guns would have their way. The Black Ships  appearance at Edo Bay in 1853 settled the issue  Japan was open. ",Japan
" Subversive currents of thought had long damned the Tokugawas as usurpers   traitors. Japan s true rulers were gods not men. The shogun ruling in Edo while the emperor languished impotently in Kyoto was sacrilege. Now the gods were reclaiming their own the foreigners their instruments. The rallying cry was Sonn  j i     Revere the emperor expel the barbarians   Unruly rioters and deadly swordsmen converged on Kyoto. Shogunal officials were cut down in broad daylight. It was chaos. ",Japan
" In the thick of things though hardly at the forefront was a remarkable woman a peasant poetess who burned with fervor to serve Japan s gods and emperor. She could not wield a sword and lamented her weak body of a useless woman.  She would wield her poetry instead. ",Japan
" Matsuo Taseko was born in 1811 in a village in the Ina Valley in today s Nagano Prefecture. The local economy was thriving. Historian Anne Walthall in The Weak Body of a Useless Woman  Matsuo Taseko and the Meiji Restoration  speaks of a rural industrious revolution  harbinger of the urban industrial one to come. Cottage industry not yet evolved into factory industry was slowly raising living standards. Taseko s father was a village headman and an entrepreneur. Farming aside he ran a ferry boat concession brewed and sold sake and lent money. He was literate and had a home library. Often he had to shoo his daughter out of it and back to her chores. She wasn t lazy   far from it   but bookishness is a passion not to be denied. If necessary she d skip meals to read. Female literacy at this time is estimated at 10 . Taseko was a very exceptional child indeed. ",Japan
" Nothing might have come of it. Peasant life could have consumed her. She married at 18 had 10 children labored in the fields raised silkworms   and wrote poetry. It was poetry that led her at age 51 to part from her family and travel mostly on foot to Kyoto on fire with nationalist ferment. She soared on wings she hadn t known she had  The scent of the plum   that perfumes the awesome reaches above the clouds  i.e. the imperial palace    now clings to the sleeve   of this base born commoner.  ",Japan
" Poetry and peasantry seem an odd coupling. Not so Walthall explains. Itinerant poets roamed the countryside. They found eager pupils. Poetry and politics merged. Taseko s teacher one Iwasaki Nagayo oriented her toward loyalism. He himself was a disciple of the nationalist thinker Hirata Atsutane  1776 1843  who d written This our glorious land is the land in which the gods have their origin and we are one and all the descendants of the gods.  ",Japan
" A poetry revolution preceded the political one. Both were restorations    politically of imperial rule poetically of verse forms harking back to pure Japanese Shinto simplicity unsullied by Buddhist and Confucian thought from China. Taseko under Nagayo s guidance reoriented her poetry accordingly. From now on  she wrote in 1861 I will follow the way of the gods.  ",Japan
" The following year she set out for Kyoto to add her poetry to the gathering storm. Caught at the mercy of the autumn winds  she wrote I resolved to visit the capital to fulfill my dreams.  ",Japan

" If woodblock prints are to be believed the metropolis was once awash in greens and blues. Reedy riverbanks grassy hillocks and marshes draped with willows all feature in One Hundred Famous Views of Edo  the 19th century series of woodblock prints of the capital  then called Edo  by master artist Utagawa Hiroshige. Above all are the waterways wide rivers and narrow canals colored a deep Prussian blue crisscrossed by gently arching wooden bridges. Boats   cargo boats piled high with barrels and steered by stooped men in sampans  pleasure boats their blinds drawn on the courtesans and patrons within   make their way up and down these causeways. One hundred and fifty years ago Tokyo at least from the right angles looked downright romantic. So the question is  What happened  ",Japan
" I m standing with Norihisa Minagawa at the entrance to a sh tengai a shopping street the likes of which can be found in neighborhoods all over Japan. This one happens to be in the Wakaba district of Shinjuku Ward. Like most sh tengai it contains the smallest of small businesses including a broom closet sized electronics store manned by an elderly man wearing a baseball cap and watching television. The street is narrow and oddly crooked. With its faded signs it looks inconsequential. But it isn t  it s a clue. Stick with me we re going for a walk. ",Japan
" Minagawa is an architect by trade. He is also the founder along with his colleague Hajime Ishikawa of the amusingly named Suribachi Gakkai  Mortar Society  a loose collective of amateur historians and machi aruki  city walking  enthusiasts. They re part of a long tradition of urban explorers that in Japan would include anyone from the sentimental early 20th century novelist Nagai Kafu to the scholar Hidenobu Jinnai author of the excellent Tokyo  A Spatial Anthology  to the Street Observation Studies Society of the 1980s whose particular mania were the uncanny oddities that Tokyo is apt at producing  decorative stairways to nowhere for example . For them and for Minagawa walking is the key to understanding Tokyo it s particular Tokyo ness and how it got to be that way. ",Japan
" People know that there are a lot of hills  in Tokyo . But people don t really walk they take the subway. So you come out of the subway and you don t know what s beyond the hill. But if you walk around on the surface you can really see the unevenness  Minagawa says. ",Japan
" Suribachi Gakkai s singular focus is Tokyo s natural topography. With a far from ironic seriousness they spend weekend afternoons charting the city s hills and valleys. It s an endeavor that involves some serious legwork as Tokyo which I have quickly come to understand has a lot of literal ups and downs. ",Japan
" Geographically Tokyo is often divided into shitamachi the lowlands of the east side of the city and yamanote the highlands to the west. Historically during the feudal Edo Period  1603 1868  yamanote was the district where the lords had their villas. Meanwhile shitamachi was the district of the common people. If you look at a topographical map of Tokyo you can see that the divide falls on a fairly straight line drawn from Ueno to Meguro where the Musashino Plateau gives way to the Sumida River delta. The Imperial Palace on the grounds of what used to be Edo Castle sits just on the edge of the highlands with a commanding view over the lowlands and Tokyo Bay. ",Japan
" Yet a closer look at the topography of the yamanote turns up a more complicated picture  The yamanote itself is perforated by rivers that run toward the bay and rivulets that end in swamps and pools. The result is an undulating unevenness a series of hills and valleys. It s a topography that sets Tokyo apart from other Japanese cities and most cities in general. ",Japan
" Tokyo is surrounded by volcanoes like Mount Fuji and Mount Hakone  the Gunma native says. When they erupted in the past they spread ash all over the region and as a result Tokyo s topsoil comprises about 20 meters deep of ash. When you combine this with the East Asian monsoons   Tokyo gets a lot of rain   you get these depressions. It s strange  the highlands are flat and then there are all these valleys that look like they ve been carved out with a spoon.  ",Japan
" Minagawa also likens these valleys to the divots on a grinding stone as if some ancient race of giants had once used the Musashino Plateau to grind their flour   hence the name Mortar Society.  ",Japan
" The day I meet Minagawa he is leading a group of 20 or so members of the NHK culture club   a sprawling organization that offers courses and seminars on diverse themes   around the eastern side of Shinjuku Ward from Shinanomachi Station to Akebonobashi Station. ",Japan
" This wasn t an official outing of the Suribachi Gakkai more like a lesson for the uninitiated on reading Tokyo like a palimpsest.  Or a neighborhood stroll with that friend who knows all the best detours and the stories they hold . Minagawa hands out photocopies of maps of our route one each from the Edo Meiji  1868 1912  and present eras. ",Japan
" Looking very much the student of the streets that he is   wearing jeans a windbreaker and sneakers and carrying a canvas satchel bag   Minagawa sets a quick pace. He leads the group southeast along Gaien Higashi Boulevard which runs along the forested grounds of the Meiji Gaien complex with its sports stadiums and halls. This is followed by an abrupt hairpin turn to the left and a steep descent. Unlike the broad regal sweep of the boulevard which was now several meters above our heads the roads in the valley below are narrow and tightly woven. We d left behind establishment Tokyo for a residential quarter a warren of two story wood framed homes awash in potted plants and airing laundry. ",Japan
" Tokyo seems to be this city of new buildings but in these valleys there are buildings that have been there since I was a child. I feel at home  says Minagawa who was born in 1963. ",Japan
" One thing about Tokyo that is interesting is that the natural topography remains. Tokyo became a city in the Edo Period about 400 years ago. Back then there were no bulldozers  everything was done by manpower  he says. Now the valleys would just be filled in the landscape would be changed. But 400 years ago the city had to be built to fit the topography. And such development remains today.  ",Japan
" So while the feudal lords built their villas high on the hills of the yamanote ordinary people filled in the river valleys in between. It was a natural arrangement  the run off from the rivers created ideal conditions for paddy farming. This explains why you can find pockets of what look like quintessential shitamachi   the two story wooden houses and narrow shopping streets   on the yamanote side of town. ",Japan
" The bones of the city were set in the Edo Period  Minagawa says. What used to be a feudal villa now still belongs to the kachi gumi society s winners  the government embassies universities and hospitals. The area with fields has always been for the ordinary people.  ",Japan
" We wind our way past a park Wakaba koen one of Tokyo s many sad asphalt slabs with just a smattering of benches and a plastic slide. According to Minagawa a park in Tokyo usually means one of two things. If it is a landscaped park with a pond  such as Arisugawa Park in Hiroo  it was likely once part of a feudal era villa.  Ponds it seems were a must for any lord worthy of his preferential plot of land . If it s paved like this one it was probably once a swamp. ",Japan
" Eventually we reach that sh tengai. ",Japan
" This used to be a river  Minagawa says pointing to the street s curiously meandering path. ",Japan
" Or rather it likely still is a river   one that now flows underground. During the heady days of postwar reconstruction leading up to the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics many of the city s waterways were diverted underground and their paths paved over. In 1960s Tokyo there was nothing so romantic as progress. ",Japan
" Lots of foreign visitors were expected for the Olympics. The rivers back then were dirty full of sewage so not good from a sanitation perspective  Minagawa says. Also they stank.  ",Japan
" So this is what happened to the rivers all but invisible unless you know what to look for  a winding street faint echoes of running water under a storm drain and addresses that include kawa the Japanese word for river. ",Japan
" If you imagine that the road you are walking on used to be a river that s kind of exciting right   Minagawa asks. ",Japan
" Yet how many Tokyoites are aware of the rivers they cross every day   A quick survey of friends suggests not so many.  The Wakaba sh tengai is but one example and many other sh tengai were also once rivers. Shibuya s main drag Center Gai and Harajuku s Cat Street are other examples. The rivers that run under each the Uda River and the Shibuya River converge under Shibuya s famous scramble crossing. It makes sense when you think about it  whenever heavy rain falls on the capital domestic TV stations send their camera crews to Shibuya for footage of taxis sloshing through flooded streets.

" What is perhaps most fascinating about this secret underground life of the city is that it still seems to be just that   a secret. And in just a generation or two the collective memory of the city will be erased. What defining elements of Tokyo will be completely forgotten in 50 years  ",Japan
" As much as Tokyo is a city of hills and valleys it is also a city of progress and engineering. The poor Edo era souls who dug the Kanda aqueduct the deep gash that you see when you take the Chuo Line past Ochanomizu may not have had bulldozers but they dug it just the same. And bulldozers eventually came anyway. So did concrete which settled over the city like another layer of ash. Increasingly it s not just the rivers but whole valleys that are getting paved over  Roppongi Hills is the classic example of a divot  that has recently been filled in. From a land distribution point of view it s a waste to have these small houses in the middle of Tokyo. Minato Ward is the liveliest area in Tokyo so it is naturally attractive to developers. In the place of a two story building you could put up a 10 story or 20 story one  says Minagawa who tries hard to be an objective observer though he admits he doesn t always succeed. ",Japan
" I hope at least some of these places with a real sense of Tokyo   a sense of history   will remain and not become just more of the same developments that could be  located  anywhere  he says. ",Japan
" Our end goal is Arakicho a particularly mazelike district stretching between Yotsuya Sanchome Station and Akebonobashi Station. Here the alleyways are paved in stone and crosshatched with telephone lines. On either side there are low rise buildings housing tiny eight seater bars and restaurants. The look is of Tokyo 50 years past. It s perfectly representative of those pockets of the old city wedged among the new. Arakicho once a Meiji Era pleasure district and now a fashionable place to eat and drink is also representative of Tokyoites  mixed feelings about the drumbeat of development. During the day it s a ghost town save for the odd bar proprietress in plastic slippers watering her plants. Come evening however when the backlit signs and paper lanterns glow and there is the click of heels on stone   ",Japan

" The Second Generation Global Imager  SGLI  instrument aboard the JAXA satellite Global Change Observation Mission Climate  GCOM C  is an optical sensor capable of observations at wavelengths ranging from near ultraviolet to thermal infrared  380nm to 12 m . SGLI can observe the polarization state of light in red and near infrared band by switching to directional angles from  45deg  forward  and  45deg  backward . Polarization measurement can provide the properties of light including the oscillation direction of electromagnetic waves in addition to the magnitude of light. ",Japan
" Polarization observation and near ultraviolet  380nm  observation by SGLI expected to characterize aerosols  fine particles in atmosphere  on Earth s land surface more accurately. In the visible near infrared spectra the surface reflectance is high over land. Vegetation and land cover affect the space based measurement resulting in varied readings. Identifying types of aerosol over land only at these wavelengths is therefore hampered by difficulties. ",Japan
" However in the SGLI ultraviolet wavelength regions the reflectance of the Earth s land is significantly lower. In addition polarization observation is less susceptible to the reflection of sunlight from Earth s surface compared with unpolarization observation. These features are expected to improve the accuracy of the measurement for aerosols over land by enabling to detect the properties of the fine particles of the atmosphere. ",Japan

" Oct. 18 2017 Updated Detection of intact lunar lava tubes in the data from Kaguya radar sounding ",Japan
" The international research team investigated the analysis of the SELENE Lunar Radar Sounder  LRS  data and confirmed that multiple lunar lava tubes exist extending a few to several tens of meters in depth underneath the volcanic region. One floor of the holes extended several tens of kilometers westward of the east end of the lava tube that LRS detected. The results from the LRS data analysis are valuable from science and future exploration perspectives as they offer evidence for the existence of previously hypothesized subsurface lava tubes. Since the insides of lunar lava tubes are believed to be in pristine state careful study of the interior provides insight regarding the evolutionary history of the Moon. Intact lava tubes shielded from the hostile outside environment offer potential sites for lunar base construction. Though lava tube caves can be buried beneath the holes few such holes have been discovered. This suggests that underground void is limited which can accommodate the lunar base for science and exploration.

" Jan. 25 2017 Updated Is there little metallic iron in the universe  ",Japan
" Solid particles containing iron  dust particles  act to promote the formation of molecules in interstellar space and are key to understanding physical and chemical processes there. Iron contained in dust particles comes in various forms such as metallic iron and iron oxide each with different properties. Previous studies have suggested that iron is present mainly in forms other than iron oxide iron carbide and iron sulfide. To verify the possibility that metallic iron is present a research team led by Dr. Kimura  Hokkaido University  performed in situ observations of gaseous iron cooling in a microgravity environment and investigated the ease of iron aggregation  the efficiency at which metallic iron forms . The experimental results showed that unlike in the results of ground experiments it was difficult for iron atoms to aggregate. In other words it is difficult for metallic iron to form in outer space. The team speculates that iron in dust particles is not a metal but rather contained as a compound or adhered to other particles as an impurity. The results of this research were published in the online journal Science Advances of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on 21 January 2017. ",Japan
" Jan. 25 2017 Updated HISAKI to Prove Solar Wind s Influence on the Inner Magnetosphere of Jupiter ",Japan

The finding contradicts the previous hypothesis that solar wind influence on the planet s inner part is negligible since its magnetosphere is huge and is rotationally dominated. Research on the response of Jupiter s inner magnetosphere to solar wind requires long continuous monitoring just the type of observation HISAKI makes. Its one month long spectroscopic observation on Jupiter updates the theory.

" Jan. 17 2017 Updated Finding the cause of a bow shaped feature on Venus ",Japan
" In December 2015 the longwave infrared  LIR  camera mounted on the Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki discovered a bow shaped feature stretching about 10000 km in a north south direction. This pattern remained in nearly the same place over the observation period of four days without being affected by the easterly wind  super rotation  in the Venus atmosphere. Examination using numerical simulations suggested that turbulence in the lower atmosphere generates waves that propagate through the atmosphere. The waves propagate north and south through the sky creating a bow like temperature distribution passing through the upper end of clouds at an altitude of about 65 km. This study showed that the state of Venus  lower atmosphere can be inferred from observations of its cloud tops. This research result was published on 17 January 2017 in the online edition of the UK scientific journal Nature Geoscience. ",Japan

" Sep. 7 2016 Updated Submicrometer craters in samples returned from the asteroid Itokawa ",Japan
" It is previously reported that precious few Itokawa particles show submicrometer craters on their surface. An international research team led by Dr. Dennis Harries  Friedrich Schiller University Jena  has investigated these craters in details using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. As a result of their observations 15 craters were confirmed on a new particle.

" Jul. 7 2016 Updated An Unexpectedly Calm Hot Gas in the Center of the Perseus Cluster ",Japan
" An international team observed the hot gas in the Perseus cluster with the Soft X ray Spectrometer  SXS  on board the X ray Astronomy Satellite ASTRO H  Hitomi  during its initial operation phase which started one week after liftoff. The total integration time was 230000 s. The energy resolution of the SXS data was high equaling the best resolution estimated during ground testing. The observation data demonstrated the good in orbit performance of the SXS and its ability to measure the velocity of hot gas with at least 20 times better resolution than previous instruments. This observation resulted in the first determination of the velocity of hot gas in the center of a galaxy cluster. At the center of the Perseus cluster a gigantic black hole emits powerful jets that collide with the surrounding hot gas and push it outward. For this reason large turbulent flows of the hot gas were expected. However the SXS observation revealed that the chaotic motion was small and the hot gas was calm despite the violent conditions. These results are presented in a paper published on July 7 2016 in the journal Nature. ",Japan

" By the observations from the Japan led Suzaku X ray satellite adn the European Space Agency s infrared Herschel Space Observatory scientists have discovered the first proof that a fierce outward wind  is produced when a huge black hole consumes a large mass of material and the wind is source of outflow of matter at the galaxy scale. Detail analysis of spectral data acquired from Suzaku s on board CCD camera found that active galactic nucleus are blown out from near edge of a center huge black hole every year at equivalent of 1.5 solar mass and at about 30  of light speed. They further describe that the black hole s activity is responsible for blowing star forming gas out of the galaxy s central regions. When the black hole shines at its brightest the researchers say it s also effectively clearing gas and dust from the galaxy s central regions and shutting down star formation there. The scientists think the observed galaxy known as IRAS F11119 3257 represents an early phase in the evolution of a quasar a type of black hole powered galaxy with extreme luminosity across a broad wavelength range.

" Jan. 25 2015 Updated Thermal vacuum test for Soft Gamma ray Detectors ",Japan
" The Soft Gamma ray Detectors  SGD  to observe the soft gamma ray region of 60 to 600 keV are under the thermal vacuum test in the 8 meter chamber at the Tsukuba Space Center to confirm their thermal design. The sensor part of the SGD does not activate till the temperature hits a low temperature of minus 20 degrees  C . However the SGDs will be installed outside of the satellite panel thus their temperature will increase from radiation from the Sun and the Earth thermal input from the satellite panel and heat from a large amount of LSI  large scale integrated circuits  and an amplifier if nothing is done. Therefore the accumulating heat will be carried to the radiator through thermal transfer and a heat pipe to be released and the SGD will be covered by the multi layer insulation  MLI  which looks like a bunch of aluminum foils to shut out heat input. The semiconductor sensor is also activated with high voltage of 200 to 1000 V hence it should also be tested if it would discharge in vacuum. Photo  The SGD 2 sits in the 8 meter chamber. ",Japan

" Nov. 20 2013 Updated Hayabusa2 Small Carry on Impactor undergoes test ",Japan
" Hayabusa2 s Small Carry on Impactor  SCI  underwent a test in October 2013. The SCI is a device to create an artificial crater of the asteroid 1999JU3 which the Hayabusa 2 will travel toward. By making and observing an artificial crater we can acquire data not only about the surface but also about the inside of the asteroid. In addition by sampling near the crater we can collect inside samples of the asteroid. Hayabusa2 applies a method to throw a metal projectile against the asteroid with high speed to create an artificial crater. Through the test this time we confirmed the accelerating part of the projectile while aiming to verify if its speed configuration and thrown direction precision met the design when the pyrotechnics which were comparable to those of actual ones for the flight were ignited to set off the projectile. The test results were very impressive as the speed and configuration were almost as designed and the direction precision was also good as the SCI precisely hit a target that was 100 meters away. We were able to successfully complete the performance confirmation test of the SCI pyrotechnic part. ",Japan

" Jan. 31 2012 Updated AKATSUKI current status and future operation ",Japan
" JAXA decided to carry out orbit control of the AKATSUKI using its liquid fuel thrusters for altitude control  or the reaction control subsystem RCS.  Based on this decision almost all of the unnecessary oxidizer was discarded in Oct. 2011. As a result the satellite became lighter and remaining fuel can be more efficiently used for orbit control. In November 2011 orbit control operation at perihelion was performed three times using the RCS for the future rendezvous with Venus and the orbit has been shifted as planned. The AKATSUKI is now flying on an orbit where it can meet with Venus in 2015   . The satellite has to be exposed to the extremely harsh thermal environment every time it passes through the perihelion until it is injected into the Venus orbit  therefore we are operating the AKATSUKI with great care to maintain its condition.

"     ",Japan
" It is desirable to inject the satellite into the Venus orbit in 2016 from a scientific observation point of view because we can put the satellite in an orbit that is closer to the equator in 2016.

" HONG KONG   Just eight months ago Chinese President Xi Jinping was snapping selfies with soccer stars in Manchester dining at Buckingham Palace and drinking beer in an English pub. ",Japan
" Queen Elizabeth hailed Xi s U.K. visit as a defining moment.  Xi and Prime Minister David Cameron heralded in a golden era  of relations establishing the U.K. as China s best partner in the West.  Xi quoted Shakespeare and stressed Britain s positive role  in deepening China s ties with the European Union. ",Japan
" Now Cameron is on the way out Britain has voted to exit the EU and Xi s being forced to reassess his strategy for the 28 member bloc China s second biggest trading partner according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ",Japan
" The U.K. has been a key advocate for China in Europe from building trade and financial links to supporting initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Beijing s leaders were counting on the U.K. s backing later this year when the bloc decides whether to grant China market economy status. ",Japan
" One major reason why China attaches great importance to its relations with the U.K. is to leverage EU policy via the U.K.  said Xie Tao a professor of political science at Beijing Foreign Studies University. London s value as a bridgehead  to Europe has been lost with Brexit Xie said leaving China to turn its focus to Germany. ",Japan
" Moreover Thursday s referendum introduced new uncertainty to the global status quo shocking financial markets and adding new pressure on China s slowing economy. Avoiding a hard landing is central to maintaining the Communist Party s own reputation as sound economic stewards. ",Japan
" Premier Li Keqiang the highest ranking Chinese leader to comment on the vote on Monday said the decision had further increased the uncertainty in the global economy.  We would like to see a united stable EU and a stable prosperous Britain  Li told a World Economic Forum gathering in the northern port city of Tianjin. ",Japan
" In the longer term the U.K. s exit could bring opportunities as well as risks. A U.K. facing marginalization in Europe could be more eager to boost ties with China a vital source of trade and financial business. The country   a key market for British cars drugs and machinery   represents 4.4 percent of the U.K. s exports about three times as much as a decade ago. ",Japan
" Brexit might end up as a blessing in disguise for China  said Ruan Zongze vice president of China Institute of International Studies a policy research group run by China s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It looks like a bad situation on the surface but there are opportunities that can be discovered and played up as long as there s effort on both sides.  ",Japan
" However a more conservative U.K. could turn instead to the U.S. and strengthen their old alliance. The nationalistic undercurrents to the Brexit debate could grow louder leading the U.K. to pull back from the free market orthodoxy that has favored greater ties with China. ",Japan
" If a more conservative leader takes over the successor may ditch the U.K. s current China strategy and move back toward its  special relationship  with the U.S.  said Zhang Baohui director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. A weakened EU which may see more defections after the British vote is not in China s grand strategic interests.  ",Japan
" Cameron spent four years overcoming the diplomatic fallout from his 2012 meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama which led to a freeze in communications with Beijing. He sought greater economic links including the award of a nuclear plant deal to Chinese companies and invested in personal ties with Xi epitomized by the fish and chips dinner they shared near Cameron s countryside estate in October. ",Japan
" Xi pledged more than  40 billion   53.6 billion  of investments during his visit including China General Nuclear Power Corp. s  6 billion contribution to building the Hinkley station in southwest England. The U.K. as an important member of the EU can play an even more positive and constructive role in promoting the deepening development of China EU ties  Xi said. ",Japan
" There s also the prospect that the Brexit result emboldens populist protectionist forces elsewhere in the West challenging a global trade system that has fueled China s economic rise at the expense of manufacturing jobs in developed economies. ",Japan
" China is a likely loser geo economically because the prospects for a more open global trade and investment environment are weakened  said William Overholt a senior fellow at Harvard University s Asia Center. The localist protectionist forces are strengthening everywhere and Brexit makes it clear that they are capable of successfully confronting the globalizing elite.  ",Japan
" The U.K. was the first European country to sign up for the China led AIIB a move that annoyed Washington but was quickly followed by Germany France Italy and others. London now handles the bulk of the EU s yuan trading and became the world s second largest renminbi clearing house worldwide after Hong Kong. ",Japan
" On the whole China would have preferred for their own self interest for the U.K. to stay in the EU  said Kerry Brown director of the Lau China Institute at King s College London and a former U.K. diplomat in Beijing. In the end I think that China will work to its advantage with whatever outcome eventually emerges.  ",Japan

" First Bt Cotton Grown in Pakistan Cotton is an important cash crop for Pakistan known as white gold . It accounts for 8.2 percent of the value added in agriculture and about 3.2 percent to GDP  around two thirds of the country s export earnings are from the cotton made up and textiles which adds over  2.5 billion to the national economy  while hundreds of ginning factories and textile mills in the country heavily depends upon cotton. Life of millions of farmers is dependent on this crop in addition to millions of people employed along the entire cotton value chain from weaving to textile and garment exports The area under the cultivation of cotton crops has been increased significantly in the last 30 years   around 7.85 million acres in 2005 06 as compared to 7.2 million acres in 2002 03. Beside being the world s fourth largest cotton producer and the third largest exporter of raw cotton and a leading exporter of yarn in the world our yield per acres ranks 13th in the world  as a result Pakistan annually imports around 1.5 2.00 million bales of cotton to meet growing demand from local textile mills  therefore it has become vital for Pakistan to increase its yield per acre. Agriculture biotechnology is helping today to provide people with more and better crops food and holds even greater promise for the future. Green revolution farming methods are coming to an end with declining yields due to environmental and soil degradation loss of seedling varieties and high input costs. So many farmers around the world are turning to genetic engineered varieties  GE  to confront with new challenges. Many Asian countries including China India Indonesia Malaysia Philippines Thailand Pakistan and Vietnam are giving high priority to plant biotechnology research in the hope of addressing the pressing challenges related to improving productivity farmers livelihoods driving rural development and meeting food security demands. Many of these countries focus their biotechnology research on food crops and non food crops and crops of high commercial value in the hope of meeting increasing food requirements and reducing use of pesticides and poverty alleviation in rural area. Farmers who cultivated these Bt cotton varieties at heart of cotton growing regions in Punjab   Bahawalpur Multan Muzaffer Garh and Karor Pakka  observed and evaluated independently its resistance and susceptibility to different pests including factors like abiotic stress and yield than compared it with non Bt cotton varieties grown in the same locations. A large number of farmers have visited these fields and become aware of the benefits of the locally developed Bt cotton. Today all major cotton producing countries are benefiting from the cultivation of Bt Cotton. In the last season 54 percent of cotton crops grown in USA 76 percent in China and 80 percent in Australia were with single  or double  Bt gene technology. India the world s third largest cotton grower has cultivated 1.36 million acres of Bt cotton crops. It is expected that within two years more than half the world s cotton may be grown from genetically modified crops. Pakistan also realizes the significance of Bt Cotton and the top political leadership including the Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz himself has said to a delegation of farmers that government would allow farmers to grow Bt cotton soon which confirms government s policy of being open to genetically modified crops in the near future. Other ministers have also spoken in favor of adopting the Bt Cotton. In May 2005 PAEC provided 40000.00 Kg basic seed of Bt cotton  insect resistant  varieties IR FH 901  IR NIBGE 2  IR CIM 448  and IR CIM 443   which have been grown over 8000 acres of land in season 2005 06. Its encouraging outcomes have surprised every one from seed companies to the farmers who cultivated these varieties. These early users of Bt cotton have been tightly screened and evaluated by PAEC on the bases of their capacity to follow Bio safety rules. ",Pakistan

" The Walled City of Lahore also known as the Old City or Anderoon Shehr is the section of Lahore that was fortified by a city wall during the Mughal era. Much of the wall remains intact today and is a popular tourist spot in Lahore. ",Pakistan
" ORIGINS OF WALLED CITY OF LAHORE ",Pakistan
" Our search for the origins of the original Lahore has immense twists and turns. It s time period can be anything starting 2000 BC onwards... at least carbon dating evidence of archaeological findings in the Lahore Fort do suggest this time period. We learn from various sources that Lahore had many names all of which changed over time. But the one name that does warrant research is  kacha kot . One of the two most probably sites of the  original  Lahore is Mohallah Maulian. Let us explore this area in this brief piece. If we focus on Sootar Mandi   the yarn market   inside Lohari Gate we can get a feel of what we are looking for. Sootar Mandi was once called Mohallah Chaileywala Hammam and is located in what was once called Machli Hatta Gulzar which is just off Chowk Chalka Lahore s original red light area. As late as 1864 according to one source quoting Mufti Tajuddin son of the well known Mufti Imamuddin the Lohari Mandi area was known among the old folk of the Walled City as  kacha kot    the mud fort. Why was this area called a  mud fort  when we know that the original walls of the Lahore Fort before Akbar the Great s days were also made of mud  This is the question that must be explored. To determine this it is important that one visits the old Walled City observe the gradient of the land the water  nullah s act as excellent guides of gradient and direction  flow and observe how  mohallahs  and  kuchas  and  kattrahs  are structured. Standing at Chowk Sootar Mandi if you observe the curve of Gali Pir Bola as it merges with Waachowali Bazaar and then also the Lohari Bazaar where it merges with Chowk Lohari Mandi and lastly where Chowk Mati where it merges with Papar Mandi you can well imagine. If you close your eyes and transport yourself 3500 years back a small mud fort with a small dwelling. The setting is perfect. Once you open your eyes it is time to observe or look for some evidence of a mud fort. If you walk along Lohari Bazaar just a short distance from Chowk Chakla  Imagine this beautiful name has been changed to a pious Chowk Bokhari   to the right you will see the street open a little for on the right is a half buried archway of  pucca  bricks and mud. Could this be from the era when Lahore was a mud fort  The evidence certainly does suggest that this could be an archway or gateway of the small original  kacha kot  way back in time a place that was to grow one day to become Lahore. It is also possible for we must not exclude any possibility that this was the famous mud fort that was built by Malik Ayaz the very first Muslim governor of Lahore. This is very probably because it is recorded history that Lohari Gate was the main entrance to Ayaz s mud fort. So no matter how you analyze recorded evidence one thing is for sure and that is that Chowk Sootar Mandi was one important centre of Kacha Kot. The lay of the streets also suggest the boundaries. In an earlier piece we had followed a similar theory and come up with the proposition that during the times of Mughal Emperor Akbar the original wall of the Walled City of Lahore was on the western side to the right of Bazaar Hakeeman in Bhati Gate and on the eastern side to the left of Shahalam Gate which then curved eastwards and formed a  kidney shaped  city that depended on the flow of the curving River Ravi. Thus the Lahore of the  kacha kot  era has continued to expand in three major leaps of expansion each with an almost 400 year gap. The eras of Raja Jaipal of Akbar and of Maharajah Ranjit Singh mark the high points of this expansion. But the expanding bubble definitely has its origins in three factors they being  a  the way the Ravi has flown and how and when it has been changing its course  b  the existence of the Lahore Fort and how power has flowed from the rulers and  c  the manner in which the population and economy of the old original Walled City has changed over time grown or even shrunk depending of invasions droughts and famines in the countryside. The story of  kacha kot  has been determined by these factors. When walking through these streets it is not hard to make out that the oldest buildings in the entire Walled City exist in this area. As one passes the old exquisite mosque known even now as Masjid Kohana Hammam Chaileywala one is reminded that the area was named similarly once. There must have been a huge  hammam  here once. The tomb of Pir Bola exists after which is named the  gali . It is sad that we tend to change the names of streets and areas and even cities at the drop of a hat as if to stamp some sort of moral authority on time. All rulers love to block out history. It would be best to let history rest and emerge as times dictate. It would not be a bad idea to declare the entire Walled City as a protected area. Let us keep for the future the little that is left of  kacha kot    the mud fort that ultimately became the Walled City of Lahore. ",Pakistan

The island is located at 24 48 00 N 66 58 00 E  24.800000 66.970000 . Manora is also a popular picnic spot because of the long sandy beaches along the southern edge of the island which merge into the beaches of the Sandspit and then extend several kilometers to the beaches at Hawkesbay. At the southeastern end of Manora island is the tallest lighthouse  28 m or 91 feet high  in Pakistan. The island lies approximately 15 20 minutes by boat ride from mainland Karachi but there are no good hotels available for an overnight stay. For this and other reasons the Government of Pakistan has been considering developing the island into a tourist destination. The island has been envisioned as an exotic location with natural landscapes such as the beaches and the mangrove forests and secluded beauty with an upgrade for the lighthouse to add to the quaint feel of the island.

" KURRAM VALLEY ",Pakistan
" The Kurrum River flows through the Kurrum Valley across the Afghan Pakistani border west to east  crossing from the Paktia Province of Afghanistan into the Kohat border region of Pakistan  at 33 49 N 69 58 E about 80 km southwest of Jalalabad. The Kurram Valley in ancient times offered the most direct route to Kabul and Gardez. The route crossed the Peiwar Pass 3439 m  11283 ft  high just over 20 km west of modern Parachinar but was blocked by snow for several months of the year. The valley is highly irrigated well peopled and crowded with small fortified villages orchards and groves to which a fine background is afforded by the dark pine forests and alpine snows of the Safed Koh. The beauty and climate of the valley attracted some of the Mogul emperors of Delhi and the remains exist of a garden planted by Shah Jahan. In the early 19th century the Kurram Valley was under the government of Kabul and every five or six years a military expedition was sent to collect the revenue the soldiers living meanwhile at free quarters on the people. It was not until about 1848 that the Turis were brought directly under the control of Kabul when a governor was appointed who established himself in Kurram. The Turis being Shiah Muslims never liked the Afghan rule. During the second Afghan War when Sir Frederick Roberts advanced by way of the Kurram Valley and the Peiwar Kotal to Kabul the Turis lent him every assistance in their power and in consequence their independence was granted them in 1880. The administration of the Kurram Valley was finally undertaken by the British government at the request of the Turis themselves in 1890. Technically it ranked not as a British district but as an agency or administered area. Two expeditions in the Kurram Valley also require mention   1  The Kurram expedition of 1856 under Brigadier General Sir Neville Chamberlain. The Turis on the first annexation of the Kohat district by the British had given much trouble. They had repeatedly leagued with other tribes to harry the Miranzai valley harbouring fugitives encouraging resistance and frequently attacking Bangash and Khattak villages in the Kohat district. Accordingly in 1856 a British force of 4896 troops traversed their country and the tribe entered into engagements for future good conduct.  2  The Kohat Kurram expedition of 5897 under Colonel W. Hill. During the frontier risings of 1897 the inhabitants of the Kurram valley chiefly the Massozai section of the Orakzais were infected by the general excitement and attacked the British camp at Sadda and other posts. A force of 14230 British troops traversed the country and the tribesmen were severely punished. In Lord Curzon s reorganization of the frontier in 1900 1901 the British troops were withdrawn from the forts in the Kurram Valley and were replaced by the Kurram militia reorganized in two battalions and chiefly drawn from the Turi tribe. In recent years the Kurram Valley has once again assumed a very strategic position and has been an area of intense military activity between the Taliban and American and allied forces. ",Pakistan

" Swat is a valley and a district in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. The capital is Saidu Sharif. With high mountains green meadows and clear lakes it is a place of great natural beauty and a popular destination for tourists. It was a princely state in the NWFP until it was dissolved in 1969. His valley and the other areas along the banks of the river Swat earliest known as Shrivastu later Suvastu and currently the present name is also the place of origin of the Shrivastava sub clan of the Indo Aryan Kayastha clan. History Swat has been inhabited for over two thousand years and was known in ancient times as Udyana. The first inhabitants were settled in well planned towns. The independent monarchs of this region came under Achaemenid influence before reverting back to local control in the 4th century BC. In 327 BC Alexander the Great fought his way to Udegram and Barikot. In Greek accounts these towns have been identified as Ora and Bazira. By 305 BC the region became a part of the Mauryan Empire. Around the 2nd century BC the area was occupied by Buddhists the Indo Greeks and the Kushans who were attracted by the peace and serenity of the land. Swat is thought to be the probable birthplace of Vajrayana Buddhism. There are many archaeological sites in the district and Buddhist relics are common testimony to their skills as sculptors and architects. Buddhist Heritage of Swat The Swat museum has the the footprints of the Buddha which were found in the Swat valley and now can be seen in the Swat museum. When the Buddha passed away His relics  or ashes  were distributed to seven kings who built stupas over them for veneration. The Harmarajika stupa  Taxila  and Butkarha  Swat  stupa at Jamal Garha were among the earliest stupas of Gandhara. These had been erected on the orders of king Ashoka and contained the real relics of the Buddha. The Gandhara School is probably credited with the first representation of the Buddha in human form the portrayal of Buddha in his human shape rather than shown as a symbol. As Buddhist art developed and spread outside India the styles developed here were imitated. For example in China the Gandhara style was imitated in images made of bronze with a gradual change in the features of these images. Swat the land of romance and beauty is celebrated throughout the world as the holy land of Buddhist learning and piety. Swat acquired fame as a place of Buddhist pilgrimage. Buddhist tradition holds that the Buddha himself came to Swat during his last reincarnation as the Guatama Buddha and preached to the people here. It is said that the Swat was filled with fourteen hundred imposing and beautiful stupas and monasteries which housed as many as 6000 gold images of the Buddhist pantheon for worship and education. There are now more than 400 Buddhist sites covering and area of 160 Km in Swat valley only. Among the important Buddhist excavation in swat an important one is Butkarha I containing the original relics of the Buddha. Source  Indo Pak Hist till 1951 Sethana family s influence started with the advent of their fore father Hazrat Pir Baba Syed Ali Tirmzi in Swat. From 1820 Sethana became place of resistance against the Sikhs and fight continued for 26 years till 1846. In fact Sethana family dominated the political scene in Usafzai area for 200 years. In 1824 Maharaja Ranjit Singh attacked Sethana itself with 100000 soldiers. Syed Akbar Shah CAST  Syed  was born in 1793  ruled Swat till 1857. His total period of rule on Hazara and Swat lasted for 12 years. His capital was at Ghalegai in Abakhel area of Swat. His great grand father Syed Zaman Shah went from Buner to Sethana and after that the family extended from Buner Malka and Swat to Sethana. In 1841 the great Indus flood destroyed Sethana followed by burning and destruction of Sethana by Sikhs and British and ultimately in 1973 it submerged under Tarbela Dam Lake. In 1852 Syed Akbar Shah fought the British at Malakand. In 1856 a mutiny supported by Nawab of Dir was crushed. In 1856 five hundred British native Infantry soldiers defected to Badshah Sahib Syed Akbar Shah but Akhund Sahib was against them and recommended their departure from Swat. He died at the age of 70 on 11th May 1857 on the day of mutiny in India. The British passed this remark   Today we have received bad news of mutiny but the good news is that Syed Akbar Shah has died otherwise the shape of the mutiny would have been different.  Syed Akbar Shah and his family gave Syed Ahmed Shahid Brelvy total protection and even after the death of Syed Ahmed Shahid his disciples were given protection in Sethana. Syeds of Sethana suffered at the hands of Sikhs and later on British for a very long time. They lost their State and property time and again for the cause of Islam. 2.His son Shehzada Syed Mubarik Shah became the ruler and fought the forces of General Chamberlain gallantly in 1863 at Ambela. He could rule only for one year. At this stage Akhund Sahib also started conspiring against the family. Infact Akhund Sahib during the life of Syed Akbar Shah started saying that he would not support the family after the death of Badshah Sahib keeping in mind the circumstances and future planning for take over by his family. By this time he had amassed huge properties and created influence by helping public through Badshah Sahib at the same times giving full support to him. The famous Enfield Rifle was used in Sethana for the first time in Subcontinent by the British forces. 3. Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah. Hassan Zai tribes killed his father Syed Mehmood Shah. When he was 6 months old his cousin Feroz Shah came from Malka attacked Sethana and killed all family male members in 1878. He was removed by a female servant and taken to a nearby village Kia and given protection by Ghulam Khel tribe. At a very young age he left for India and lived with his stepbrother who was borne and lived in Lukhnow since his child hood. In Azam Garh he studied with a Persian scholar Maulvi Qamaruddin Maulvi Nazir ud Din and Maulvi Kabir Ullah who were Arabic and Persian teachers in Banaras. He came back and again went for studies in 1890. In 1897 he took part in Landakai war. In 1899 Nawab of Amb Akram khan appointed him as his Minister at a very young age. After the death of Nawab his son Khan Zaman Khan became ruler. He married the daughter of Nawab of Amb in 1907. From childhood he developed love for Islam and history mainly because of his family background. He had photographic memory whatever he studied once he never forgot till his death. He was Hafiz e Quran and wrote many books mainly on the history of Pakhtoons  Al Hibrat Bani Israel and Four Hundred Years old history of Frontier . He went on foot right up to Qundoos north Afghanistan in 1905 to confirm his ancestral history. According to Sir Olaf Caroe   he was an authority on the history of Pathans.  In 1903 he went to Delhi and met a very respected personality and Saint Shah Abdul Kher Mujaddi. In 1908 he re captured Sethana with the help of Nawab of Amb and constructed Fort and house. In 1908 he married the daughter of ruler of Bokhara who had come to Abbottabad after revolution via Afghanistan with the help of Amir Abdul Rehan of Kabul. He ruled Swat from 28 April 1914 to 1918. His capital was at Niphikhel area Bandi Bala. Immediately after taking over as ruler he organized an Army and proper income tax in Islamic way. Shariat law was to be followed. The Army was properly paid monthly pay. After 2 years in 1916 Mian Gul Abdul Wadood CAST  Gujar  mutinied but was arrested. He pardoned him and Mian Gul fought under his command against Nawab of Dir.He gave in writing on Holy Quran that he would never rise against him. His written statement of request for Pardon duly stamped is still available. He was sent for Hajj but on his return he conspired with the British and with their active help overthrew him. British have confirmed their help against him and their animosity against Syed family in number of books. In 1912 Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayum requested him for help for Islamia College. He got Rs. 100000   from Nawab Khan Zaman Khan and gave it to him. Again in 1939 he was exiled by the British to Hyderabad Deccan. The Nizam appointed him as his Defense Minister and remained there till 1945. While he was in Hyderabad Sahibzada Sahib again asked him for help for Islamia College. He again got Rs. 150000   from Nizam and sent it to him. Mian Gul s status as ruler was accepted in 1926 although he was supported and installed by the British. In the beginning of the 11th century AD Mahmud of Ghazni advanced through Dir and invaded Swat defeating Gira the local ruler near Udegram. Later when the King of Kabul Mirza Ulagh Beg attempted to assassinate the dominant chiefs of the Yousafzais they took refuge under the umbrella of the Swati Kings of Swat and Bajour. The whole area was being dominated by the Swati Jahangiri Sultans of Swat for centuries. According to Major Raverty Jahangiri Kings of Swat had ruled from Jalalabad to Jehlum. After more than two decades of guerilla war they were dispossessed by the Yousafzais. The majority of the aboriginal inhabitants of Swat migrated to the Hazara region to the east where Swatis predominate with their surname Swati reflecting their link to the region. Demographics The main language of the area is pashto. The people of Swat are mainly Pashtuns Kohistanis and Gujars. Some have very distinctive features and claim to be descendants of the army of Alexander the Great. The people of the Kalam region in northern Swat are known as Kohistanis and speak the Torwali and Kalami languages. There are also some Khowar speakers in the Kalam region. This is because before Kalam came under the rule of Swat it was a region tributary to both Yasin and Chitral and after Yasin itself was assimilated into Chitral the Kalamis paid a tribute of mountain ponies to the Mehtar of Chitral every year. Tourist attractions There is a ski resort in Swat at Malam Jabba as well. Malam Jabba is about 40km north east of Saidu Sharif. It is the most popular ski resort in Pakistan. The ski slope is also the longest in Pakistan at about 800m. Administrative Set up The region has gone through considerable changes over the last few years. Mainly since the dissolution of the princely state. Local Politics In August 2001 a new local government system was introduced by the Military led government of Pervaiz Musharraf the new system consists of a District Nazim  or mayor  and a deputy Naib Nazim the district in turn was subdivided into two tehsils. The first is Swat tehsil with 52 union councils and the other is Matta Tehsil with 13 union councils. Each tehsil has its own Nazim and Naib Nazim. The District Nazim is Jamal Nasir Khan of the Pakistan Muslim League and his Naib Nazim is Malik Sadiq Ahmed. Swats tehsil s Nazim is Fazal Rehman NoNo from the Pakistan People s Party Parliamentaerians. While its Naib nazim is Shah Dawran from the Awami National Party.

" GAWADAR PORT ",Pakistan
" Gwadar port is located at Gwadar city at the entrance of the Persian Gulf on Arabian Sea and about 460 km west of Karachi in Balochistan Pakistan. Gwadar port is a deep sea warm water port being constructed in two phases with heavy investment from China. Gwadar has had immense geostrategic significance on many accounts. In 1993 Pakistan started technical and financial feasibilities for the development of Gwadar port. The Gwadar port project started on 22 March 2002. The first phase was completed in December 2005. Gawadar port was inaugurated on March 19 2007 after the completion of second development phase. Gawadar port is Pakistan s first deep port that has the capacity to serve virtually all sorts of cargo ships of any size. Port Operations Port of Singapore took over Gwadar Port by the end of January 2007. Port of Singapore was the highest bidder for the Gwadar port after DP world backed out of the bidding process. Originally Chairman of Dubai Ports World Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem who met President Pervez Musharraf on May 5th 2006 expressed a strong hope for management of facilities at the strategic Gwadar deep sea port and development of infrastructure in the southern port city and elsewhere in Pakistan.But They took the decision not to bid after India s National Security Council had voiced concerns about DP World s ventures in India alongside its Pakistani plans and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem assured the Indians their pull out was well considered and India need not have any security concerns.The port will now be in competition with the likes of Chabahar a port in Iran as well as Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

" The Port Muhammad Bin Qasim is a port in Karachi located at 24 46 00 N 67 20 00 E  24.766667 67.333333 . It was constructed in the late 1970s to relieve congestion at Karachi Port. Port Qasim was named after the Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim who captured the area around 712 CE. The port was developed close to the Pakistan Steel Mills complex near the Indus River delta. Port Qasim s residential area is a neighbourhood of Bin Qasim Town of Karachi. Port Qasim is managed by Port Qasim Authority. Port Qasim is Pakistan s second busiest port handling about 35  of the nation s cargo  17 million tons per annum . It is located in an old channel of the Indus River at a distance of 35 kilometers east of Karachi city centre. The total area of the port comprises 1000 acres  4 km   with an adjacent 11000 acre  45 km   industrial estate. The approach to the port is along a 45 kilometre long Navigation Channel which provides safe navigation for vessels up to 75000 DWT. The geographic position of the Port places it in close proximity to major shipping routes. One of its major advantages is the proximity to national transport facilities   15 kilometers from the Pakistan National Highway 14 kilometers from the National Railway network through six railway tracks located immediately behind the berths and 22 kilometers from Jinnah International Airport.

Jiwani is located at the eastern end of Gwadar Bay which is shared between Iran and Pakistan. The area around the bay includes an important mangrove forest extending across the international border and is an important habitat for a wide variety of wildlife especially the endangered Olive Ridley and Green Turtles. Plans to grant fishing concessions and offshore drilling rights are potentially a threat to the wildlife of the area. Jiwani holds strategic importance in the region located immediately adjacent to the shipping lanes to and from the Persian Gulf. This is the main reason that the town hosts a small naval base and an airport with a 5500 foot runway. ",Pakistan
" KARACHI PORT ",Pakistan
" The Port of Karachi is Pakistan s largest and busiest seaport handling about 60  of the nation s cargo  25 million tons per annum . The port is located at 24 50 00 N 66 58 30 E  24.840000 66.980000  between the Karachi towns of Kiamari and Saddar close to the heart of old Karachi. The port is located close to the main business district of Karachi and several industrial areas. The geographic position of Karachi places the port in close proximity to major shipping routes such as the Straits of Hormuz. The administration of the port is carried out by the Karachi Port Trust which was established in the nineteenth century. Description The port comprises a deep natural harbour with an 11 km long approach channel which provides safe navigation for vessels up to 75000 DWT. The main areas of port activity are two wharves   East Wharf with seventeen vessel berths and West Wharf with thirteen vessel berths. The maximum depth alongside the berths is currently 11.3 meters. The two wharves extend in opposite directions along the upper harbour   the West Wharf southwest from Saddar town and the East Wharf northeast from Kimari Island. The flow of cargo to and from the port is hampered by severe congestion in the harbour with several other maritime facilities located close to the port. Adjacent to the West Wharf is the Karachi Fishing Harbour which is administered separately from the port and is the base for a large fleet of several thousand fishing vessels. The West Wharf also hosts a ship repair facility and shipyard and a naval dockyard at the tip of the wharf while to the south of the port are the Karachi Naval Base and the Kimari Boat Club. The Port of Karachi also faces competition from a new private terminal located 5 kilometres away in the larger harbour west of the port. In recent years the federal government has attempted to alleviate the increased congestion in the harbour by constructing a second port in Karachi thirty kilometers east at Port Qasim and a third major port at Gwadar about 650 kilometers west of Karachi. The Karachi Fishing Harbour has been upgraded and a second fishing harbour is located 18 kilometres away at Korangi. The transfer of some naval vessels to the new naval base at Ormara has brought about further reductions in congestion. Ancient History The history of the port is intertwined with that of the city of Karachi. Several ancient ports have been attributed in the area including Krokola Morontobara  Woman s Harbour   mentioned by Nearchus  Barbarikon  the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea  and Debal  a city captured by the Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim in 712 CE . There is a reference to the early existence of the port of Karachi in the Umdah by the Arab navigator Suleiman al Mahri  AD 1511  who mentions Ras al Karazi and Ras Karashi while describing a route along the coast from Pasni to Ras Karashi. Karachi is also mentioned in the sixteenth century Turkish treatise Muhit  The Ocean  by the Ottoman captain Sidi Ali Reis. The Muhit is a compilation of sailing directions for a voyage from the Portuguese island of Diu to Hormuz in the Persian Gulf warning sailors about whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in Kaurashi harbour if they found themselves drifting dangerously. There is a legend of a prosperous coastal town called Kharak in the estuary of the Hub River  west of modern Karachi  in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century. In 1728 heavy rains silted up the harbour and resulted in the merchants of Kharak relocating to the area of modern Karachi. In 1729 they built a new fortified town called Kolachi  sometimes known as Kalachi jo Kun and Kolachi jo Goth  on high ground north of Karachi bay surrounded by a 16 foot high mud and timber reinforced wall with gun mounted turrets and two gates. The gate facing the sea was called Kharadar  salt gate  and the gate facing the Layari River was called Mithadar  sweet gate . The modern neighbourhoods around the location of the gates are called Mithadar and Kharadar. Surrounded by mangrove swamps to the east the sea to the southwest and the Layari River to the north the town was well defended and engaged in a profitable trade with Muscat and Bahrain. From 1729 to 1783 the strategic location of Kolachi saw the town change hands several times between the Khans of Kalat and the rulers of Sindh. In 1783 after two prolonged sieges the town fell to the Talpur Mirs of Sindh who constructed a fort mounted with cannons on Manora Island at the harbour entrance. The prominence of the port attracted the British who opened a factory in Karachi at the end of the eighteenth century but disagreements with the Mirs on trade tariffs led to the closure of the factory. The British were concerned about Russian expansion towards the Arabian Sea so in 1839 they occupied Karachi and later the whole of the Sindh. The port served as a landing point for troops during the First Afghan War. Modern History The potential of Karachi as a natural harbour for the produce of the Indus basin led to rapid development. The Indus Steam Flotilla and the Orient Inland Steam Navigation Company were formed to transport cotton and wheat down the Indus river to Karachi. A number of British companies opened offices and warehouses in Karachi and the population increased rapidly. By 1852 Karachi was an established city with a population of 14000 and a prosperous overseas trade. The modern port began to take shape in 1854 when the main navigation channel was dredged and a mole or causeway was constructed to link the main harbour with the rest of the city. This was followed by construction of Manora breakwater Kiamari Groyne the Napier Mole Bridge and the Native Jetty. The construction of the wharves started in 1882 and by 1914 the East Wharf and the Napier Mole Boat Wharf were complete while 1927 and 1944 the West Wharf the lighterage berths and the ship repair berths were constructed between 1927 and 1944. From the 1861 the Sindh Railway line connected Karachi to the cotton and wheat producing areas of the Sindh and northern British India and by 1899 Karachi was the largest wheat and cotton exporting port in India. The period between 1856 and 1872 saw a marked increase in trade especially during the American Civil War when cotton from Sindh replaced American cotton as a raw material in the British textile industry and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Another major export was oil brought by rail from the Sui region in Balochistan. Karachi s importance as a gateway to India increased in 1911 when the capital of British India was moved to Delhi. The city was an important military base during the First World War  1914 18  because it was the first Indian port of call for ships coming through the Suez Canal and was the gateway to Afghanistan and the Russian Empire. In 1936 the Sindh district of the Bombay Presidency was reorganised as a new province with Karachi as the capital instead of the traditional capital of Hyderabad. This led to new public services and buildings thus increasing its population and importance. Karachi was again a military base and port for supplies to the Russian front during the Second World War  1939 1945 . In 1947 Karachi became the capital of the new nation of Pakistan resulting in a growth in population as it absorbed hundreds of thousands of refugees. Although the capital moved to Islamabad in 1959 Karachi remains the economic centre of Pakistan accounting for the largest proportion of national GDP based in part on the commerce conducted through the Port of Karachi and Port Qasim. Post Independence the port witnessed tremendous growth as a result of being the largest port in Pakistan. The port was targeted by the Indian Navy  codenamed Operation Trident  during the hostilities of the 1971 war. Port Facilities The port has thirty dry cargo berths three liquid cargo handling berths  oil piers  two ship repair jetties and a shipyard and engineering facility. These are arranged in two main wharves   the West Wharf and the East Wharf each including a container terminal    ",Pakistan

" Environmental Concerns The area around the harbour includes several mangrove forests which are constantly under threat from human activities. To the east of the port lies Chinna Creek which covers about 6 km  and is dotted with mangrove islands. To the southwest of the port is another much larger mangrove forest in the bay formed by several islands and Manora breakwater  the river Layari flows into this bay bringing waste from upstream suburbs. The beach immediately east of the harbour was the scene of a significant oil spillage when the Greek registered Tasman Spirit ran aground in August 2003. The environmental impact included large numbers of dead fish and turtles and damage to a key mangrove forest as well as dozens of people suffering nausea. Karachi Dock Labour Board The Karachi Dock Labour Board  KDLB  is responsible for labour relations between employees and the Karachi Port Trust. In October 2006 the Pakistan government has decided to close down Karachi Dock Labour Board by December this year as part of its landlord port strategy and under the National Trade Corridor  NTC  programme. The closure of KDLB would cost around Rs 4.2 billion   70 million  to the national exchequer. The World Bank in its report suggested in case of closure the KDLB would have to pay about Rs one million to each employee. There are about 3895 employees and officers on its payroll. Of which about 3673 are dockworkers  185 staff members  and 37 are officers. The total payoffs calculated by the bank would be around Rs 4.2 billion. ",Pakistan

" KALABAGH DAM ",Pakistan
" The Kalabagh dam is a mega water reservoir that Government of Pakistan planning to develop across the Indus River one of the world s largest rivers. The proposed site for the dam is situated at Kalabagh in Mianwali District of the northwest Punjab province bordering NWFP. The dam project is a highly controversial and has been so since its inception. In December 2005 General Pervez Musharraf who became the President of Pakistan after a 1999 coup announced that he would definitely build the dam in the larger interest of Pakistan. History The region of Kalabagh was once an autonomous jagir  feudal estate  within Punjab. It was annexed by the Sikhs in 1822. After the British annexed the Punjab the Nawab of Kalabagh was granted the jagir of Kalabagh in recognition of his services to the British Raj. According to the PC II of the Project Kala Bagh dam was initiated by GOP in 1953 and until 1973 the project was basically considered as a storage project for meeting the irrigation needs and consequently rapid increases in the cost of energy have greatly enhanced the priority of the dam as a power project. The project s paperwork was finalized in March 1984 with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme  supervised by the World Bank for the client Water and Power Development Authority  WAPDA  of Pakistan. Controversy The proposed construction of the Kalabagh Dam triggered an extremely bitter controversy among the four provinces of Pakistan namely Punjab Sindh North West Frontier Province and Balochistan. The only province which is in favor of this dam is Punjab that is the most strong among all four provinces as usually the government is mainly centralized in it. The other three provinces have expressed extreme dissatisfaction going so far as to have their provincial assemblies pass unanimous resolutions condemning the proposed dam. Hence the project is still under consideration. The delay is also being caused by the fact that according to international water distribution law the tailender has a legal and natural right on river and that is why no mega construction or reservoir can be built without permission and endorsement of the tail ender i.e. Sindh. In the case where the tail ender is not using water i.e. building a water reservoir a reservoir can be made upstream. Impact assessments of the proposed dam have shown that while it will provide storage and electricity the dam will also have adverse impacts on the environment as can be expected from any large dam. It will also displace a large number of people. While proponents point to the benefits the adverse factors have been played up by the opponents of the dam. As a result the dam has been stalled by claims and counterclaims since 1984. The controversy can be best understood by looking at the viewpoints of each of the four provinces. Punjab viewpoint Punjab   the granary of Pakistan   desperately needs more water to keep up with the growing population and industrial demands on its agriculture. A dam at Kalabagh would also supply cheap hydroelectric power. The annual outflow of water into the Arabian Sea is considered a waste in Punjab which feels that water can be used to irrigate Pakistani infertile lands. Punjab wants not just Kalabagh but also two more large dams on the Indus at Bhasha and Skardu Katzarah. It feels that the Kalabagh site is the most favourable compared to the other two and that it should be built first. Sindh viewpoint Sindh the first province to point KBD project a blame game is the lower riparian and strongest opponent of KBD. But its case mainly against Punjab is more on a conceptual basis of what Sindh thought to be theft of water by Punjab rather than locating an actual incident of theft. Sindh supports its argument by stating that by virtue of its name and history of water rights of the province Indus River belongs exclusively to Sindh. Therefore claiming the construction of dams Tarbela and Mangla and now KBD actions of theft of water at the irrigation cost of Sindh. Further Sindh presents many objections against the proposed dam. Some of these objections are as follows  ",Pakistan
" Sindh objects that their share of the Indus water will be curtailed as water from the Kalabagh will go to irrigate farmlands in Punjab and NWFP at their cost. Sindhis hold that their rights as the lower riparian have precedence according to international water distribution law. ",Pakistan
" The coastal regions of Sindh require a constant flow of water down the Indus into the Arabian Sea so that the flowing water can keep the seawater from intruding inland. Such seawater intrusion would literally turn vast areas of Sindh s coast into an arid saline desert and destroy Sindh s coastal mangroves. ",Pakistan
" With the construction of dams such as Mangla Dam and Tarbela Dam across the Indus Sindhis have seen the once mighty Indus turned into a shadow of its former glory downstream of the Kotri Barrage up to Hyderabad. They fear that there simply is not enough water for another large dam across the Indus let alone three. ",Pakistan
" The Kalabagh site is located in a highly seismic zone near an active fault and the underlying rocks are likely to contain numerous fractures causing the reservoir water to seep through the catacomb of fractures and discharge at the lowest point around the reservoir and the Indus River. ",Pakistan
" Damming the Indus has already caused a number of environmental problems that have not yet addressed. Silt deposited in the proposed Kalabagh dam would further curtail the water storage capacity of Manchar Lake and other lakes and of wetlands like Haleji Lake. ",Pakistan
" President General Musharraf and other leaders such as Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz have promised  iron clad  constitutional guarantees to ensure that Sindh gets its fair share of water. However these assurances mean little to most Sindhis who point out that even the earlier 1991 Indus Water Sharing Accord which is a document already guaranteed by the constitutional body the Council of Common Interests has been violated and that Punjab has  stolen their water. ",Pakistan
" The objection to Kalabagh in Sindh is widespread. Even political parties of Sindh that are in the central cabinet and are supported by General Musharraf such as the MQM have strongly denounced the dam. NWFP viewpoint The NWFP has two main objections to the dam. ",Pakistan
" While the reservoir will be in the NWFP the dam s electricity generating turbines will be just across the provincial border in Punjab. Therefore Punjab would get royalties from the central government in Islamabad for generating electricity. Contrary to this however Punjab has agreed not to accept any royalties from the Kalabagh Dam. The fact that the NWFP will suffer the adverse consequences of the reservoir but not get royalties is seen as unfair. ",Pakistan
" Concerns that large areas of Nowshera district would be submerged by the dam and even wider areas would suffer from waterlogging and salinity as has occurred with the Tarbela Dam. ",Pakistan
" Balochistan viewpoint The dam does not directly affect the Baloch as such. Rather most nationalist Baloch Sardars sees the dam as another instance of Punjab lording it over the smaller provinces. By opposing the dam they are signaling their disaffection with being the poorest province and most neglected of all in development. In reality Balochistan can only get more water and its due share after the construction of Kalabagh dam and Kachhi canal. The Common Man s Viewpoint Majority of people of Pakistan are against the construction Kalabagh dam as its construction can prove a danger to sustain the unification of provinces under the name  Pakistan . The only people who want the construction of Kalabagh dam can be classified into two groups  The first is the high ranked officers of Pakistan army who will be granted farmlands to be irrigated by Kalabagh dam after the retirements  in fact these are the most powerful supporters of dam . The second group is the political leaders of Punjab  since the issue has turned out be a war between Sindh and Punjab so by favouring the construction of Dam Punjabi politicians can maintain their vote bank. The only reason why President Pervaiz Musharaf favours Kalabhgh dam is because he needs the support of Punjab to sustain his dictatorship in the country. All the  oppressed  provinces  Sindh NWFP and Balochistan  of the country has already expressed a huge concern over the construction of dam specially in Sindh where every single street has observed the protest against the dam. The people of these oppressed provinces do not believe in any guarantee from  Punjabiz  Pakistani government as it has already done many decisions against the constitution treaties for example the regulation of water in Chashma Jehlem link canal. Analysis Most independent analysts believe that the foremost problem with the proposed dam at Kalabagh is one of a trust deficit between the Punjab on one side and the other three provinces on the other. The noted columnist Ayaz Amir suggested that the people of Punjab should redefine their assumptions about the rest of Pakistan and distribution of resources. A layman of Punjab does not understand why the rest of Pakistan does not trust Punjab. The answer according to Amir lies in the frequent coups staged by the Pakistan Army  which is overwhelmingly Punjabi in its composition  as well as the Army s extra constitutional intervention and influence in public sector and civil institutions of the country in general and Sindh in particular. Now no province is ready to trust the Punjab. All Pakistanis agree that Pakistan faces a severe water shortage and that some form of water management must be implemented soon. Many point out that even if work on Kalabagh were to start tomorrow it would still take at least eight years to complete and commission such a large dam. In the meantime the water situation would continue to worsen. Smaller dams barrages and canals must be built before that and water conservation techniques introduced. The WAPDA for years repeatedly changed its statistics on the dam to the point where no one in Pakistan now believes any of its figures. Government of Pakistan formed a technical committee headed by A. N. G. Abbasi to study the technical merits of the Kalabagh dam vis   vis the other two. The four volume technical report concluded that Bhasha or Katzarah dam should be built before Kalabagh further complicating matters. To make matters even more complex the report also stated that Kalabagh and Bhasha Dams could be considered feasible. The abrupt way in which President General Musharraf announced the decision to build the dam simply overruling the objections of the smaller states has sharply polarised public opinion. In Punjab the view is one of  ...its high time  while in the other states especially Sindh the reaction has been one of  ...over my dead body  . The fact that the General literally dragged so controversial an issue off the backburner and thrust it into national centre stage without considering the predictable reactions from the smaller provinces has left many aghast. Much has been said in the press and the issue is still far from being resolved. ",Pakistan

" MANGLA DAM ",Pakistan
" As per the Indus Waters Treaty signed in 1960 India gained rights for the Ravi Sutlej and Beas rivers while Pakistan in addition to waters of above three rivers in her area and some monetary compensation got rights to develop the Jhelum Chenab and Indus river basins. Until 1967 the entire irrigation system of Pakistan was fully dependent on unregulated flows of the Indus and its major tributaries. The agricultural yield was very low for a number of reasons the most important being a lack of water during critical growing periods. This problem stemmed from the seasonal variations in the river flow and the absence of storage reservoirs to conserve the vast amounts of surplus water during periods of high river discharge. The Mangla Dam was the first development project undertaken to reduce this shortcoming and strengthen the irrigation system. The dam was damaged partially during an Indian Air Force bombing in the Indo Pakistani War of 1971 when the hydel project was hit by the bombs. ",Pakistan
" The Mangla Dam project ",Pakistan
" The Mangla Dam the twelfth largest dam and third largest earth filled dam in the world is only 115 km southeast of Rawalpindi. One has to turn left from Dina Town and the dam on river Jhelum is about 14 km to the east. It was constructed in 1967 across the Jhelum River about 100 miles southeast of the federal capital Islamabad. The main structures of the dam include 4 embankment dams 2 spillways 5 power cum irrigation tunnels and a power station. The main dam is 10300 feet long and 454 feet high  above core trench  with a reservoir of 97.7 square miles. Since its first impounding in 1967 sedimentation has occurred to the extent of 1.13 MAF and the present gross storage capacity has declined to 4.75 MAF from the actual design of 5.88 MAF. The live capacity has declined to 4.58 MAF from 5.34 MAF. This implies a reduction of 19.22  in the capacity of the dam. The project was designed primarily to increase the amount of water that could be used for irrigation from the flow of the Jhelum and its tributaries. Its secondary function was to generate electrical power from the irrigation releases at the artificial head of the reservoir. The project was not designed as a flood control structure although some benefit in this respect also arises from its use for irrigation and water supply. In the centre of the dam there is a Gakkhar Fort from where one can have a panoramic view of the lake. ",Pakistan

Tarbela Dam is part of the Indus Basin Project which resulted from a water treaty signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan guaranteeing Pakistan water supplies independent of upstream control by India. Construction began in 1968 and was completed in 1976 at a cost of Rs.18.5 billion. Over 15000 Pakistani and 800 foreign workers and engineers worked during its construction. It is the biggest hydel power station in Pakistan having a capacity of generating 3478 MW of electricity. The dam has a volume of 138600000 cubic yards  106000000 m  . With a reservoir capacity of 11098000 acre feet  13.69 km   the dam is 469 feet  143 m  high and 8997 feet  2743 m  wide at its crest while total area of the lake is 260 sq.km. It helps to maintain the flow of the Indus during seasonal fluctuations. A new smaller hydroelectric power project has been developed downstream known as the Ghazi Barotha Hydel Power Project. It is solely for generating electricity and has a water channel with the highest flow in the world. While the dam has fulfilled its purpose in storing water for agricultural use in Pakistan there have been environmental consequences to the Indus river delta. Reductions of seasonal flooding and reduced water flows to the delta have decreased mangrove stands and the abundance of some fish species. Permits are required for visiting the Dam.

On the other two sides are agricultural areas. NAMAL dam is situated some 32 KM from Mianwali city. This dam is very old. British Government constructed it. When Mianwali became District then the district government buildings were constructed using water stored in Namal Lake from this Namal Dam. In 1913 British engineers to meet the scarcity of irrigation and drinking water built a dam on this lake and from here they irrigated lands up to Mianwali city. But with the passage of time and construction of Thal Canal and installation of tube wells its utility of water squeezed up to some limit. The gates of the dam are repaired by the irrigation department regularly but without enthusiasm. The hill torrents and rains fill the Namal Lake round the year. Due to a drought like situation in the country this lake dried up last year which is the first incident of its kind during the last 100 years said one of the senior inhabitants of this area. An engineer told this correspondent that the name of Namal Dam still exists on the list of dams in the world. Namal Lake is an ideal abode for the migratory birds in winter season when thousands of waterfowls including Russian ducks and Siberian cranes land in the lake water. Due to the apathy of the wildlife department these guest birds are ruthlessly killed by poachers. To save these birds the wildlife department must declare this lake a sanctuary.

" PESHAWAR CLUB GROUND ",Pakistan
" The Peshawar Club Ground is a cricket ground in Peshawar Pakistan used for one Test match between India and Pakistan. It staged first class cricket matches from 1938 to 1987. History of matches The history of first class cricket at the Peshawar Club Ground began with the North West Frontier Province in the Indian Ranji Trophy. With the separation of Pakistan in 1949 the NWFP team was admitted into the Quaid e Azam Trophy and again played at Peshawar until they were replaced in the Trophy by a Peshawar city team in 1956. Before that Pakistan had entertained India for the only Test match to be played here. In a drawn four day encounter Polly Umrigar hit a century for India before he was run out. The following year New Zealand played a Governor General of Pakistan s XI here while a full strength Pakistan side beat a non Test touring team from Marylebone Cricket Club. For Quaid e Azam Trophy matches the Peshawar team switched between this ground and the Peshawar Gymkhana Ground until 1971. In 1957 Peshawar off spinner Haseeb Ahsan achieved the best figures on the ground with thirteen for 47 in a match against Punjab B. Touring teams occasionally visited the ground though no more Test matches were played. In 1967 a MCC U 25 side played a Pakistan North Zone team a match which is notable for Mike Brearley s highest first class score. The visitors  captain made 312 not out in a day as MCC piled up 514 for four against opposition including the later Test captain Intikhab Alam declared then won by an innings and 139 runs on the third day. He shared double century stands with Alan Knott and Alan Ormrod  records for the first and fifth wickets at the ground  and his innings remains the highest on the ground despite Zakir Butt s 290 for Pakistan Railways six years later. Matches by touring teams became more common in the 1970s with England India New Zealand Sri Lanka  then not a Test nation  all playing a team at this ground. Most matches were drawn though England won by the use of two declarations while New Zealand lost against a team with nine players who would appear in the Test series against them. An International XI captained by Vanburn Holder also beat a near full strength Pakistan here in 1976 though the match did not have international status. By November 1984 the new Arbab Niaz Stadium in Pakistan was ready and the Club Ground was disused. It hosted Peshawar for the last time in their 1986 87 Quaid e Azam Trophy campaign where they played eight home matches and since then the Arbab Niaz has taken over as Peshawar s international and first class ground of choice.

" BALA HISAR FORT ",Pakistan
" Bala Hisar Fort is one of the most historic places of Peshawar. The word Bala Hisar is from Persian meaning  elevated or high fort . According to Dr. Hussain Khan the name was given by the Afghan King Taimur Shah Durrani  1773 1793 . The Sikhs who conquered Peshawar in the early 19th century named it Samir Garh in 1834 but the name did not become popular. The fort stands on a high mound in the northwestern corner of Peshawar City. No long ago the fort used to be conspicuously away from the old city of Peshawar but now the construction of new buildings has covered space between the old city and the fort. However the fort being high gives a commanding and panoramic view of Peshawar and the entire Peshawar valley. On a clear day one can see the mountains encircling Peshawar valley and beyond. The area covered by the inner wall of the fort is about 10 acres and the outer wall is about 15 acres. The height of the fort is about 90 feet above ground level. History Renowned historian Dr A.H. Dani in his book Peshawar Historic City of Frontier writes that when Hiuen Tsang a Chinese traveller visited Peshawar in 630 AD he spoke of a royal residence. He says that Chinese word Kung Shing used for its significance and is explained as fortified or walled portion of the town in which the royal palace stood. Hiuen Tsang then made a separate mention of the city which was not fortified. This shows that the royal residence formed the nucleus of a Citadel which must have been further protected by a moat. Dr Dani further says that a channel of old Bara River surrounded by a high spot which includes the Balahisar and Inder Shahr. The higher area could have been the citadel which is the present Balahisar. Peshawar has always been a strategic city and its capturing and ruling over it was of great importance for the invaders and kings. In the 11th century AD the Hindu ruler Raja Jaipal of the Hindushahi dynasty was defeated in the vicinity of Peshawar and Mehmud Ghaznavi garrisoned the fort with his army says Dr Taj Ali. The British officers who visited Peshawar in 19th century mentioned that the fort used to be a royal residence of Afghan rulers he added. The Afghan rulers named it Balahisar a Persian name meaning high fort while the Sikhs renamed it as Samargarh in 1834 but the name remained unpopular says Dr Taj. The fort was constructed on a mound with commanding view of the surrounding area including Shalimar gardens presently known as Jinnah Park towards its north. This gave more prominence and grandeur to the fort he said. In the past Balahisar has seen its construction and destruction by conquerors worriers invaders and kings on several occasions. After the overthrow of emperor Humayun by the Afghan King Sher Shah Suri the Afghans destroyed the fort. When Hamyun was staying in it he decided to rebuild it before proceeding to Kabul. He wanted to use the fort for his conquest of India at a later stage. As his officers did not want to stay back Hamayun himself supervised the rebuilding of the fort which was soon completed. The fort also remained the residence of legendary Afghan king Ahmed Shah Durrani and his son Taimur Shah Durrani. The Sikhs captured Peshawar and the fort in 1834 following the battle of Nowshera he added. The Sikhs first destroyed the fort and later either by Hari Singh Nalwa or Sardar Khurruck Singh rebuilt it keeping in view its importance. However Sher Singh on the orders of his father Ranjit Singh erected the fort with unbaked bricks. On the entrance of the main courtyard of the Balahisar fort a Sikh period inscription in marble can be seen on an arch gate. This is the only inscription available today in Balahisar which reads Victory to Porak. This was built by Raja Bikramajit and was named Samir or Samar Garh. The British reconstructed Balahisar after the annexation of Sikh Shahi areas in 1849. At that time the fort had mud walls and was not very strong. The British replaced the whole structure with bricks and the present shape was given to the fort. ",Pakistan
" BALTIT FORT ",Pakistan
" Baltit Fort or Balti Fort is an ancient fort in the Hunza valley in the Northern Areas of Pakistan. In former times survival of the feudal regimes of Hunza was ensured by the impressive Baltit fort that sits on top of Karimabad. The foundations of the fort are said to date back around 700 years but there have been rebuilds and alterations over the centuries. In the 16th century the Thum married a princess from Baltistan who brought master Balti craftsmen to renovate the building as part of her dowry. The architectural style is a clear indication of Tibetan influence in Baltistan at the time. The Mirs of Hunza abandoned the fort in 1945 and moved to a new palace down the hill. The fort started to decay and there was concern that it might possibly fall into ruin. Following a survey by the Royal Geographic Society of London a restoration programme was initiated and supported by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture Historic Cities Support Programme. The programme was completed in 1996 and the fort is now a museum run by the Baltit Heritage Trust. ",Pakistan
" DERAWAR FORT ",Pakistan
" Derawar Fort is an ancient fort located 48 Km from Dera Nawab Sahib in Cholistan Desert in Pakistan. The Fort was built by Deoraj a prince of Jaisalmer. It was in possession of royal family of Jaisalmer when it was captured by Abbasis in 1735. In 1747 the Fort slipped from the hands of Abbasis in the reign of Nawab Bahawal Khan due to his pre occupations at Shikarpur. Nawab Mubarak Khan took the stronghold back in 1804. It is still in a good condition. The rampart walls are intact and still guarded by the personal guards of the Amir of Bahawalpur. The tombs of the ex rulers of Bahawalpur and their families are located in this fort. The tombs have nice glazed blue tile work. Prior permission of the senior Amir of Bahawalpur is required to enter the fort. ",Pakistan
" KOT DIJI FORT ",Pakistan
" The Kot Diji Fort formally known as Fort Ahmadabad dominates the town of Khairpur in Pakistan about 25 miles east of the Indus River at the edge of the Nara Rajisthan Desert. The initial fortifications were made from 1785 to 1795 by Mir Sohrab Khan Talpur founder of the Kingdom of Upper Sindh in 1783. They comprised a 12 feet wide mud wall that had bastions throughout its length and a huge iron gate. The fort was considered invincible and served as the residence of the Ameers of Khairpur in war and peace. It is therefore the ancestral home of Khairpur. When the royal house  Zenana  moved into the comfort of palaces it stood mainly as a decorated reminder of more violent times. Throughout its whole history however Fort Kot Diji was never attacked. Construction Kot Diji is a very practical fort constructed on a limestone hill with kiln baked bricks. Bricks were used because the locally available limestone rock was very brittle and would have shattered easily on impact with a cannonball. The hill is over 100 feet high above which the walls of the fort rise another 30 feet. It has three strategically placed towers about 50 feet tall. The fort is about 1 km long. Its walls are segmented by about 50 bastions and its 2.6 km perimeter identically follows the double crescent shaped contours of the hill it stands on. This allows the fort to surround the attacking enemy on three sides on the west front. On the east where the entrance lies the fort is divided by three elephant proof gates into three overlapping levels so that the first two levels can be attacked by the next level above them in the event of the lower level being overrun by the enemy. The first gate is not a prominent portal but rather an indirect entry so that the gate cannot be rammed on a charge. The walls and bastions have slits in them allowing defenders to attack their enemy from two levels  from on top and from within the wall. The fort was built at a time when cannons had become common and its design and position reveals that. It includes a multitude of stations for cannons and because it is positioned high on a narrow ridge enemy cannons would have had to fire at a great distance permitting little accuracy. Cannonballs could either hit the hill or perimeter or would simply fly over the fort and fall on the enemies  own forces on the other side. Location Kot Diji was located at the edge of the desert  this provided an advantage over enemies marching from the east because an exhausted army could be met before it could take supplies and water from the irrigated lands. In fact the Mirwah canal was built in 1790 specifically to irrigate the lands west of the fort and bring water to the military base. Role under the British Empire The Kingdom of Upper Sindh later was recognized by the British as the princely state of Khayrpur after the East India Company had reduced its area to less than a third of its original size of about 50000 km . The Fort was allocated the role of central military base for the Kingdom especially to resist Afghan invasion. It was the strongest of the 20 or so Talpur forts and was named after the Persian architect Ahmed who designed it. According to folklore it took 30 years to build  in reality a much shorter tactically feasible period may have been possible by mobilizing peasants and soldiers on a massive scale. Recent history After the merger of the State with Pakistan in 1955 the fort could have been included with the personal property of the Mir of Khairpur  as is the case with other ex sovereign rulers who still possess their forts . However Mir Ali Murad II thought it appropriate to hand it over to the government of Pakistan expecting better maintenance. Since then the fort has fallen into serious disrepair and is presently in a derelict condition. Most of the lime mortar plaster has fallen of the walls leaving the bricks exposed. During the dictatorship of Ayub Khan 192 cannons and mortars based at and collected in the fort were stolen or destroyed by being thrown from the bastions  other decorative fixtures and fittings were stolen as well. Apart from many indigenously made cannons the collection included those built for Nadir Shah the Kachar emperors and the Kalhora Mughal and Safavid dynasties along with antique European cannons. In 1994 the provincial government of Sindh leased out the limestone hill on which the fort stood for demolition and quarrying for limestone extraction in order to construct buildings and form foundations for government built roads. However public outrage   focusing partly on the abundance of limestone throughout the region   caused the surprised government to back down. Today the town wall is barely visible. The massive historic Iron Gate was sold for scrap soon after the takeover of Khairpur by Pakistan. Here as with other places Khairpur s heritage and history are being erased  some claim that this part of a deliberate effort by the federal government to erase the Khairpur identity. In 1995 a check of 500 rupees  approximately US 8  was provided for the repair of Kot Diji. Repeated requests by citizens for permission to repair it privately have apparently been ignored. In 2005 about 25 million rupees were handed over to a repair scheme which has apparently left it even more damaged. Sand was used as mortar to replace the original mortar and as a result the walls are highly susceptible to rainfall. Recently the federal government handed over the fort to the government of Sindh. Since Sindh which nominally has a provincial status is widely considered to have a corrupt government it is perhaps unlikely that the fort will benefit. However Prince Mir Mehdi Raza Khan Talpur  younger of the two sons of the ex ruler  is giving personal attention to the fort and has stated his commitment to its repair if sufficient funds can be acquired.

" LAHORE FORT ",Pakistan
" The Lahore Fort locally referred to as Shahi Qila citadel of the city of Lahore Punjab Pakistan. It is located in the northwestern corner of Lahore adjacent to the Walled City. Some of the famous sites within the fort are  Sheesh Mahal Alamgiri Gate Naulakha pavilion and Moti Masjid. The fort is 1400 feet long and 1115 feet wide. In 1981 the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the Shalamar Gardens. Origins According to available historical information the origin of Lahore Fort is obscure. Traditionally the foundation of Lahore and its fort is based on myths and is attributed to Lav the son of Rama Avatara of Lord Vishnu of Hinduism and hero of the Ramayana of epic age  1200 800 B.C. . However during the excavation done in the year 1959 A.D. by the Department of Archaeology in front of Diwan e Aam a gold coin of Mahmood of Ghazni dated A.H. 146  1025 A.D.  was found at a depth of 25 feet from the level of the lawns. Cultural layers continued to a further depth of 15 feet giving strong indications that people had lived here long before the conquest of Lahore by Mahmud in 1021 A.D. Further mention of the fort is traceable to Shahab ud Din Ghori s successive invasions of Lahore from 1180 to 1186 A.D. Timeline It cannot be said with certainty when the Lahore Fort was originally constructed or by whom since this information is lost to history possibly forever. However evidence found in archaeological digs gives strong indications that it was built long before 1025 A.D. ",Pakistan

" Ranikot is a large fort in the region of the Kirthar Range about 30 km southwest of Sann was in the Dadu district of Sindh now in district Jamshoro approximately 90 km north of Hyderabad in Pakistan. It is one of the largest forts in the world. It has an approximate diameter of 9 km. Its walls are on the average 6 meters high and are made of gypsum and lime cut sandstone and total circumference is about 29 km. While originally constructed for bow and arrow warfare it was later expanded to withstand firearms. It is reputed to be the largest unexplored fort in the world. The purpose of its construction and the reason for the choice of its location are still unknown. Ranikot is the most talismanic wonder of Sindh. Visible from five kilometers away its massive undulating walls twist and dip over the hills. With the circumference of more than twenty nine kilometers its walls built with dressed sandstone and reinforced with 45 bastions along the outer wall of which 7 are rectangular and the remaining are round. All modified through the ages to accommodate the use of gunpowder this perhaps makes it the largest fort in the world. Who constructed it first and why is an enigma yet to be resolved by researchers. Some historians attribute it to Arabs built by Imran Bin Musa Barmaki the Governor of Sindh in 836 A.D. some to Sassanians and some to the Greeks or Romans and some to the Persians and some even to the Great Wall of China  Though the prehistoric site of Amri  Aamri  is nearby and fossils and animal skeletons are found inside the fort on the Lundi Hills there is no trace of any old city inside the fort. The present structure doesn t appear to be  prehistoric . Some historians point to 17th century AD as its time of first construction but most agree that some of the present structure was constructed or reconstructed by Mir Karam Ali Khan Talpur and his brother Mir Murad Ali in 1812 AD at a cost of 1.2 million rupees. This enchanted fort is located in Lakki Mountains of the Kirthar range on the right side of the mighty River Indus at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the present day town of Sann. A mountainous ridge  Karo Takkar   Black Hill  running north to south forms its western boundary and the  Lundi Hills  forms its eastern boundary.  Mohan Nai  a rain stream enters the fort from its rarely used western  Mohan Gate  where it is guarded by a small fortification changes its name to  Reni  or  Rani Nai  or rain stream and gives the fort its name. Ranikot is thus the  fort of a rain stream    Rani. It runs through it tumbles in a series of turquoise pools to irrigate fields and leaves the fort from its most used  Sann Gate  on the eastern side. It then travels about 33 kilometers more to enter the Lion River   Indus. Most of the twenty nine kilometers long wall is made of natural cliffs and barricades of mountainous rocks which at places rise as high as two thousand feet above sea level  Only about 8 km portions of its wall are man made built with yellow sandstone. This was first measured on foot by Badar Jamal Abro along with Syed Jalal Mehmud Shah and local guide Sadiq Gabol. Badar Abro has also written a book on the Fort. As one enters the fort one can find hills valleys streams ditches ponds pools fossils building structure bastions watchtowers ammunition depots fortresses   all inside the Ranikot adding more to its beauty and mystery. A spring emerging from an underground water source near the Mohan Gate is named as  Parryen jo Tarr   the spring of fairies . According to a tale told by the local inhabitants fairies come from far and wide on the Ponam Nights  full moon  to take bath at this spring near  Karo Jabal   Splashing sounds of water falling on the rocks can be heard at another spring  Waggun jo Tarr  or the Crocodile Spring named so as crocodiles once lived there. Meeri and Shergarh fortresses Within Ranikot there are two more forts   Meeri and Shergarh fortresses. Meerikot takes its name from the word  Mir  meaning top. Both the main Ranikot and the inner Meerikot have similar entrances   curved angulated with a safe tortuous path. The bridge in front of Ranikot resembles to a smaller bridge in front of a fortress in Verona Italy  writes Ishtiaq Ansari the writer of  Sindh ja koat aaein qillaa   Forts and Fortresses of Sindh  and a member of Sindh Exploration and Adventure Society. From the military point of view Meerikot is located at a very safe and central place in the very heart of the Ranikot with residential arrangements including a water well. Talpur Mirs used Meerikot as their fortified residence. One can explore ruins of the court harem guest rooms and soldiers  quarters inside it. Its 1435 feet long wall has five bastions. Every structure in the Ranikot has its own uniqueness and beauty. Looking up from Meerikot one can find another fortified citadel   Shergarh  Abode of Lions  built with whitish stone. Though its location at 1480 feet above the sea level makes this fortress a unique structure it also makes it equally difficult for supply of water which can only be had from the brooks and rain streams hundreds of feet below  The steep climb upto Shergarh gives a commanding view down over the whole fort and its entrance and exit points. On a clear day one can even see Indus 37 kilometers away to the east. Beside the Mohan Gate and the Sann Gate there two more gates rather pseudo gates. One is towards the side of ancient town of Amri. This  gate  is called the  Amri Gate . Certainly it takes its name from the prehistoric ruins of Amri but it must have taken this name much later than the times of Amri as the fort itself doesn t appears to be as old as the Amri itself. In fact there is a bridge over rain stream  Toming Dhoro  exiting from the fort called  Budhi Mori . The breach in fort wall due to the river stream has been referred as a gate. Similarly the Shahpir Gate to the south also appears to be a pseudo gate taking its name from a limestone rock with a rough shape of foot imprinted on it. The sacred footprint supposedly belongs to Hazrat Ali or some other religious personality and is venerated by locals. It seems to be a later breach in the fort wall instead of a formal gate because one can t find any bastion or watchtower or their remains at the site needed to guard any formal entrance or exit points. A mosque found in the fort appears to be a later modification of a watchtower. Scattered animal skeletons and prehistoric fossils can be found on the top of Lundi Hills. One of the three graveyards has about four hundred graves made of Chowkundi like sandstone with engraved motifs of sunflowers and peacocks. Whether we can call them as theriomorphic and phytomorphic motifs is an open question. Another one appears to be a graveyard of Arabs. The third one about a mile away from the Sann Gate had sixteen or seventeen graves earlier but now there are only four graves. The local inhabitants call it the Roman s graveyard. The fort is notoriously deficient of shelters and shady places but the view of the terrain from the top of  Shimla Hills  is not only attractive but mystifying too  The size of Ranikot defies all reasons. It stands in the middle of nowhere defending nothing writes Isobel Shaw. So why was this fort built here in the desolate terrain of the Kirthar range  Many theories have been developed to answer this question. According to Ishtiaq Ansari the Talpurs had sent their families to Thar and Kachchh when Afghan s attacked Sindh during the times of Kalhoras. However after acquiring the rule of Sindh they wanted a safe and secure place where they can send their families during the troubled times. This might have prompted them to rebuild this fort to their needs. Rahimdad Khan Molai Sheedai holds view that its location in Kohistan on the western frontiers of Sindh gave it its strategic value. Talpurs  they are Balouch by origin  had good terms with Khan of Kalat  Head of all Balouch Tribes  Talpurs were helped by them when they attacked Kalhoras and in return they gifted Karachi to Khan of Kalat and wanted a secure western frontier. Mazher Ali Ansari is of the view that Persians  Achaemenid Empire 559 BC   338 BC  were the first to construct this fort to secure their eastern frontier from the Indian rulers as their empire extended from the Caspian Sea in the west to the River Indus in the east which also served as a natural boundary and barrier. They had constructed a similar wall of 155 km called the Gorgan Wall near the Caspian Sea to protect their empire. Beside this in olden times a trade route from Mesopotamia Iran  Kirman Shah Hamadan Sulatanabad Qum Bimpur  Mekran and Sindh  Amri Sehwan Mohenjo daro  used to pass from this area. Another branch of this route traversed Thano Arab Khan Karchat Sann an Amri to reach Brahmanabad on the left bank of the mighty River Indus. Hence the importance of the location in earlier times if the fort existed then. The condition of fort is rapidly deteriorating as is the case with most of archeological heritage of Sindh. One third of the man made walls have already collapsed and the rest may soon follow suit. Access to this man made marvel of ancient times is possible through a motor able road which goes up to Meeri Kot. A 4x4 is recommended. ",Pakistan
" ROHTAS FORT ",Pakistan
" Rohtas Fort is a garrison fort built by the Great Afghan King Sher Shah Suri. He named Qila Rohtas after the famous Rohtasgarh Fort in Shahabad district near Baharkunda Bihar which he captured from the Raja of Rohtas Hari Krishan Rai in 1539. Rohtasgarh is situated on the upper course of the river Son 20 37  N and 85 33 E. It was built by Harish Chandra of the Solar dynasty and was named after his son Rohitasva after whom the fort  Rohtasgarh  was named. Reasons of Construction Sher Shah constructed Qila Rohtas to block Emperor Humayun return to India after defeating him in the Battle of Kanauj. This fort lies on the old GT Road between the North  Afghanistan  to the Plains of Punjab. It blocked the way from Peshawar to Lahore. The other reason was to suppress the local tribes of this region Potohar called Gakhars who were allies of Humayun and refused their allegiance to Sher Shah Suri. Location Qila Rohtas is situated in a gorge approximately 16 km NW of Jhelum. It was constructed on a hillock where the tiny Kahan River turns east towards Tilla Jogian Range. Overview of Construction Qila Rohtas is a garrison fort and could hold a force of up to 30000 men. Due to its location massive walls trap gates and 3 Baolis  stepped wells  it could withstand a major siege although it was never besieged. The fort is irregular in shape and follows the contours of the hill it was constructed on. The fort is approximately 4 km in circumference. A 533 meter long wall divides the citadel  for the Chieftain  from other parts of the fort. The fortification has 68 bastions  towers  at irregular intervals. Out of the 3 Baolis one of them is in the citadel and the rest are in the other parts of the fort. One of the Gates  Langar Khani  opens into the citadel and is a trap gate because it is in the direct line of fire of the bastions. The Khwas Khani gate is an example of double walling. A small enclave on the western side is a citadel within a citadel. It is accessible by only one gate and also had a very fine Baoli which suggests that it was meant for the Chief and his family. In this citadel there is a beautiful Masque called the Shahi Mosque  Not to be confused with the one in Lahore . There are no palaces in the Fort except for a structure built by Raja Man Singh called the Haveli of Man Singh. It is built on the highest point of the citadel. Cost of Construction The work on this fort was started in 1541 with Todar Mal Khatri the revenue minister in charge of the project. The Gakhars whose area the fort was built on refused to provide labor for this project. Todar Mal faced with such problems informed Sher Shah about these difficulties who wrote in reply  I know you for a man of business understanding and intelligence. I see no work can be expected from you because you consider money as your friend. When I have commanded you to do a thing you ought not to have cared for money in fixing the rate. Whatever be the expenses shall be borne by my government.  After receiving this reply he fixed one red Ashrafi for each slab on the first day. The rate gradually decreased to one Paoli or Bahluli. Because of the boycott the cost of construction was huge. It would have been much lower had it not been for the Ghakkars. The following sources all give slightly different estimates of the cost Waqiat i Jahangiri says the cost was Rs. 3425000. It refers to an engraved stone over the Shishi Gate which reads   The amount is 16 10 00000 Dams and something more which is 34 25000 Rupees of Hindustan 120000 Tumans of Iran or 12175000 Khanis of Turan . According to Tarikh i Daudi its cost is 80505002 Dams  Bahlulis . Fortification Wall The height of the outer wall varies between 10 and 18 meters. Its thickness varies between 10 and 13 meters. The wall has 2 or 3 terraces and varies in thickness the maximum being 13 meters near the Mori Gate. The terraces are linked by staircases. The topmost terrace has merlon shaped battlements. Muskets can be fired from these battlements. Soldiers could also pour molten lead over the walls. The wall is built in sandstone laid in lime mortar mixed with brick. The gates are in grey Ashlor Masonry. Some portions have been built using burnt brick. The Gates The Rohtas Fort has the following 12 gates. All of them are built in Ashlor Stone. ",Pakistan
" Sohail Gate ",Pakistan
" This gate is the best example of masonry in use in the time of Sher Shah. It derives its name from a Saint names Sohail Bukhari buried in the southwestern bastion of the gate. Others say that it was names after the Sohail Star which rises on this side of the fort. It is a double gate rectangular in shape. It is 21.34 meters  70 feet  high 20.73 meters  68 feet  wide and 15 meters  50 feet  deep. The central archway is 4.72 meters  15 feet  wide. It has an inner and an outer arch which is decorated with beautiful and simple motifs of sunflower. This decoration is repeated in all parts of the Qila. There are balconies on either side of the central arch. These balconies have a small dome and their sides and bottom are also decorated. Unlike other parts of the Qila which has been built in Afghan Persian style the balcony is an example of Hindu architecture. These same balconies can be seen in Haveli Man Singh. There is a small window in the middle of the outer arch. This window is different from the two balconies to either side of the outer arch. It is much simpler that these two balconies. There are seven merlons on this gate. The bastions are with battlements which have loopholes. These bastions have three levels on the inside. The inner side of the gate mirrors the outside but has less decoration. There are no battlements towards the inside and no balconies either. The rooms in the upper storey of this gate have windows that open towards the inside of the Qila. Like the outer arch there is a small window in the middle of the inner arch. The gate now houses a Visitors information center and a Museum set up by the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation. ",Pakistan
" Shah Chandwali Gate ",Pakistan
" This gate links the citadel to the main fort. It is named after a Saint Shah Chandwali who refused to get his wages for working on this gate. The saint died while still on work and was buried near the gate. His shrine still stands to this day. This gate is also a double gate. The outer gate the entrance of which is from the citadel is 13.3 meters wide and 8.23 meters deep. The inner gate is a simple archway which is 3.66 meters wide. ",Pakistan
" Kabuli Gate ",Pakistan
" This gate opens to the west and is named  Kabuli  because it faces Kabul. It is a double gate and its opening is 3.15 meters  10 feet  wide. It has two bastions on each side. The gate has 5 battlements on top and has stairs leading up to it from the outside. On the southern side of the gate is the Shahi  Royal  Mosque because of which many people also call it Shahi  Royal  Darwaza  Gate or Door . There is a Baoli near this gate. ",Pakistan
" Shishi Gate ",Pakistan
" The gate derives its name from the beautiful glazed tiles used to decorate its outer arch. These tiles are the earliest examples of this technique which was later refined in Lahore. These tiles are blue in color. An inscription on the left side of the gate gives the date of construction of the fort. The inscription is in Persian and is translated as follows In the Hijri Year 948 came the exalted At that time constructed the great fort The emperor is Sher with long life There is no match to his good fortune Itwas completed by Shahu Sultan. The Hijri year 948 is 1541 AD. ",Pakistan
" Langar Khani Gate ",Pakistan
" It is a double gate 15.25 meters  50 feet  high 3.5 meters  11.5 feet  wide with a central arched opening. The outer arch has a small window like the Sohail Gate. The outer opening leads to a Langar Khana  Mess or Canteen . There are two bastions on either side of the gate which have kitchen stores and a well for water. The opening of this gate is L shaped. As soon as one enters from the outer gate one has to turn right. ",Pakistan
" Talaqi Gate ",Pakistan
" This gate is 15.25 meter high and 13.8 meter wide with two bastions on either side. This gates name derives from  Talaq   divorce . According to a legend Sabir Suri entered the gate and had an attack of fever which proved fatal. This was regarded as a bad omen and the name became  Talaqi . ",Pakistan
" Mori or Kashmiri Gate ",Pakistan
" The gate opens to the north and faces Kashmir. This gate opens into one chamber which opens into another. ",Pakistan
" Khwas Khani Gate ",Pakistan
" This gate is named after one of Sher Shah Suri s greatest general Khwas Khan. This was the original entrance to the Qila  Fort  because outside the gate lies the old GT Road. It is a double gate. The outer gate is 12.8 meter wide  42 feet  and 8 meter  26 feet  deep. This gate has a bastion and a defensive wall on each side. On the bastions canons could be deployed. The inner and outer gates are almost mirror images of each other. The top of the gate has five battlements. All of these have loopholes as well as machicolation. Unlike other gates of this Qila the inner side of the gate has five battlements. The inner and outer arches have sunflower motifs like the Sohail Gate. The gate also has a room which has windows opening to the inside and the outside. ",Pakistan
" Gatali Gate ",Pakistan
" It is a single gate 9.15 meter high and 6.1 meter deep. This gate faces Gatali Ford  ravine  thus the name. ",Pakistan
" Tulla Mori Gate ",Pakistan
" This is an entrance rather than a gate. It is on the eastern side of the fort. It is about 2 meters wide. There is a bastion next to this entrance. ",Pakistan
" Pipalwala Gate ",Pakistan
" This is a small entrance like the Tulla Mori Gate. It is 2.13 meter wide. ",Pakistan
" Sar Gate ",Pakistan
" This is a small entrance. There is a bastion next to this gate. There is a Baoli next to this gate. It is called  Sar  because  Sar  means water. Other Buildings ",Pakistan
" Shahi Mosque ",Pakistan
" This small mosque is near the Kabuli gate. It has a prayer chamber and a small courtyard. The prayer chamber is 19.2 meter long and 7.3 meter deep. It is divided into 3 equal chambers. There are domes from the inside but from the outside no domes can be seen. This mosque is built into the fortification wall i.e. soldiers walked over the mosques roof. The outer wall of the mosque is the fortification wall itself. On the outer wall of the mosque are beautiful round designs in which Islamic verses are written in Naqsh script. These verses are surrounded by a Lilly going around the Naqsh script. The Lilly design was later used by Mughals in Tomb of Jahangir Tomb of Nur Jehan and the Shah Burj Gate in Lahore Fort. The design seems to have been copied from the coins used in that time. ",Pakistan
" Baolis ",Pakistan
" There are 3 Baolis in the fort. These were made by cutting deep into the lime rock. They are  1.The Main Baoli in the middle of the Fort for soldiers elephants horses etc. This Baoli has 148 steps. Each step is 20 cm  8 inches  wide. The upper portion has been cut in stone. It has arches three arches that span the length of the baoli. ",Pakistan
" The Shahi Baoli near the Kabuli Gate for the Royal family. It has 60 steps and has small chambers that were used as baths by the Royal family. ",Pakistan
" A small Baoli near the Sar Gate most likely used by soldiers. ",Pakistan
" Haveli Man Singh ",Pakistan
" This is not an original structure of the fort. It was built by a general of Akbar Raja Man Singh I of Amber. He died in 1614 so it must have been built between 1550 and 1614. It is a 2 storey building constructed with bricks and plastered neatly. Architecturally it bears no resemblance to the Qila Rohtas. A part of the structure has fallen away. There seems to have been 4 rooms out of which only one exists now. The existing room is 5.5 meters square and there are balconies on the outside of it. These balconies are similar to the one outside Sohail Gate. One could see the whole fort from these balconies. Unlike Qila Rohtas which is an example of Afghan architecture this Haveli is an example of pure Hindu architecture. ",Pakistan
" Gallows ",Pakistan
" There is a small gallows near Haveli Man Singh. It is a one storey structure. One room has been built on top of another. There was an upper storey where people would be hanged or their head would be cut off. The lower chamber would be used to collect the body. Bricks seem to have been used in the construction of this building which makes it likely that it was not an original structure of the fort. In addition it is near Haveli Man Singh which makes it likely that it was built later than the main Qila. Decorative Features This fort is an example of purely  Masculine  architecture. It places function over form. This can be gauged from the fact that the fort had NO building for living. Even Kings had to live in tents when they came here. Stone Carvings These carvings are found on the gate and in the mosque. Most of these are engravings in Arabic and sunflowers. Calligraphic inscriptions Most of these inscriptions are on the Shahi Mosque. On top of the mosque the word  Allah  is written on merlon shaped arches. On the outer wall of the mosque are the  Kalima  and other religious inscriptions. There is an inscription in Persian on the Shishi gate which gives the date of start of construction. The same inscription is also found over the Talaqi gate. There are other inscriptions on the Khwas Khani Langar Khani and Gatali gate. Glazed Tiles These tiles are found on Shishi gate. This type of tile became extremely popular with the Mughals who further refined them. The tiles on Shishi gate are the earliest example of the usage of these tiles. These tiles were made in Lahore. Plaster Plaster has been used in the Shahi Mosque. Architectural Style This fort was built in the Afghan Persian architectural style. Afghans and Persians Kings had been coming to the Indian subcontinent for at least 5 centuries before the construction of this fort. Before the construction of this fort the combination of these styles had not been harmonious. Qila Rohtas is the earliest example of the successful mixing of these two styles with the Afghan style being more prominent. The elements of Hindu Architectures are 1. Balconies on Sohail Gate. 2. Decorations on Shahi Mosque derived from Hindu Architecture. 3. Haveli Man Singh  Pure Hindu Architecture . The elements of Afghan architecture are 1. Utilitarian Construction. 2. Use of stone instead of bricks in building wall. 3. No Living quarters. 4. Comparatively less decorations. Usage Sher Shah Suri died before the completion of this magnificent structure. Ten years after Sher Shah s death and the end of the Suri dynasty Emperor Humayun returned to rule India for another 15 years. When Humayun returned the Governor of Rohtas Tatar Khan Kasi fled. This fort was never popular with the Mughals because of its military character. Emperor Akbar stayed here for a single night. Emperor Jahangir rested here for a single night while going to Kashmir for some R R. He said the following about its location. This fort was founded in a cleft and the strength of it cannot be imagined.The later Mughals seem to have made no use of the fort. The Durranis kept a garrison and a Governor here. The Sikhs held power after the Durranis Maharaja Ranjit Singh was in camp here when he heard the news that his greatest general Hari Singh Nalwa had been killed at Jamrud by the Pukhtuns under the leadership of Wazir Akbar Khan a son of the great Amir Dost Mohammad Khan. The Kabul suburb of Mina Akbar Khan is named to honour the memory of this great Afghan general. The Maharaja gave the fort to Sardar Mohar Singh who was succeeded by Gurmukh Singh. It was subsequently leased to different people and the last people to manage Rohtas was Raja Fazal Din Khan who joined Sher Singh in rebellion. History The history of Rohtas is a long and chequered one. From old texts and inscriptions found near Rohtas it appears that the fort was in the possession of the Hindu king Pratapdhavala of the Japla dynasty. Other inscriptions mention that it was ruled by the Khayarwala clan who were sovereigns of Shahbad  the area now known as Bhojpur and Rohtas . Historians are of the opinion that the Hindu kings of Rohtas did a lot of construction   a road through the jungle leading from the foothill to the plateau the fortifications on the jungle roads plus the four gates on the four ghats. The main fortifications at the Raja ghat and the Katauthiya ghat can still be seen. Apart from a matrix for making seals belonging to the 7th century king Sasanka all other artifacts are from the time of Sher Shah Suri onwards. 1500s The fate of Rohtas took a turn in 1539 when it fell out of the hands of the Hindu kings into those of Sher Shah Suri. At war with the Mughal emperor Humayun he had just lost the fort at Chunar and was desperately trying to gain a foothold for himself. Sher Shah made a request to the ruler of Rohtas that he wanted to leave his women children and treasure in the safety of the fort while he was away fighting in Bengal. The king agreed and in the first few palanquins there were women and children but the later ones the wily Sher Shah had substituted with fierce Afghan soldiers who captured Rohtas forcing the Hindu king to flee. During the Sher Shah s reign the fort was guarded by 10000 armed men under the command of one of his trusted general Haibat Khan Niazi. Haibat Khan Niazi built the Jami Masjid in 1543 AD which lies to the west of the fort and is made of white sandstone consisting of three domes. Another monument of this time is a mausoleum perhaps of the daroga  superintendent of works  of Sher Shah Habsh Khan. Then in 1558 Rohtas saw the rule of Man Singh Akbar s Hindu general who made it his political stronghold. Northern India had been under Mughal rule in contrast eastern India was highly unstable with the various kings putting up resistance against the Mughals. Man Singh as governor of Bengal and Bihar made Rohtas his headquarters in view of its inaccessibility and other natural defences. He constructed a beautiful palace for himself which is still in a fairly good condition repaired the rest of the fort cleared the ponds and made gardens in Persian style. The palace was constructed in a north south direction with its entrance to the west with barracks for soldiers in front. The main gate is known as the Hathiya pol or elephant gat named after the figures of the behemoths which decorate it. It is the largest of the gates and was made in 1597. 1600s After the death of Man Singh the fort came under the jurisdiction of the office of the Emperor s wazir  Prime Minister  from where the governors were appointed. In 1621 the Prince Khurram  later Emperor Shahjahan  revolted against his father Jehangir and fled to the safety of Rohtas where the guardian of the fort Saiyyad Mubarak handed over the keys of Rohtas to the prince. Once more Khurram tried to win avadh but lost the battle of Kampat and again sought refuge in Rohtas. It was here that his son Murad Baksh was born to his wife Arjumand Bano who later became as famous as Mumtaz Mahal. During Aurangzeb s reign the fort was used as a detention camp for those under trial and for housing prisoners sentenced for life. 1700s 1800s Once again the fortunes of Rohtas changed. In 1763 in the battle of Udhwa Nala the Nawab of Bihar and Bengal   Mir Kasim lost to the British and fled with his family to Rohtas. But Mir Kasim s luck was out and he fared no better at the fort. Finally the Diwan of Rohtas Shahmal handed it over to the British Captain Goddard. During his two month stay at the fort the captain destroyed the storeroom and many of the fortifications. When Goddard left he put some guard in charge but they too left after a year. Perched on a plateau where the fertile land and abundant water supply once supported 10000 matchlock men Rohtas was now empty. There was peace at the fort for the next 100 years or so which was finally shattered during the time of the First War of independence in 1857. Umer Singh the brother of brave Kunwar Singh together with his companions took refuge here. There were many encounters with the British where the latter were at a disadvantage for the jungles and the tribals in them were of great help to the Indian soldiers. Finally after a long drawn out siege and many skirmishes the British overcame the Indians. Architectural Legacy Here is what the World Heritage list  Document 586  says on page 2 of the report   Rohtas Fort is an outstanding example of early Muslim military architecture in the Indian subcontinent which incorporates features from elsewhere in the Islamic world. It also had a profound influence on the development of architectural styles in the Mughal Empire  and hence on the European colonial architecture that made abundant use of that tradition .   It is also outstanding by virtue of the refinement and high artistic value of its decorative elements notably its high  and low relief carvings its calligraphic inscriptions in marble and sandstone its plaster decoration and its glazed tiles.  And  There are no surviving examples of military architecture of this period on the same scale in the sub continent which survive to the same degree of completeness and conservation. Fatehpur Sikri  India  which is already on the World Heritage List represents the full Mughal realization of a form and style that owes everything to its precursor Rohtas Fort.  The recommendation by ICOMOS  the organization that makes the World Heritage list  made the following recommendation   Rohtas Fort is an exceptional example of the Muslim military architecture of central and South Asia which blends architectural and artistic traditions from Turkey and the Indian sub continent to create the model for Mughal architecture and its subsequent refinements and adaptations.  Present State Most of the fort is in a very good state of preservation. In the portions that have fallen away  Haveli Man Singh  one can still see some part of the original construction. The central archway of the Chandwali Gate has been rebuilt recently so that is the only  fake  part of the fort. In early 2005 seepage heavy rains and general neglect caused the left inner face of the Talaqi Gate to collapse and the right flank and foundation to become detached from the original structure. The Gatali Gate forms one of the original entrances to Rohtas. Over time its right bastion and supporting wall have collapsed as a result of permeated rainwater and the erosion of its foundations. World Heritage Site Qila Rohtas was designated a World Heritage Site in 1997. Here is what the World Heritage list says on page 3 of the report   That this property be inscribed on the World Heritage List. Rohtas Fort is an exceptional example of the Muslim military architecture of central and South Asia which blends architectural and artistic traditions from Turkey and the Indian sub continent to create the model for Mughal architecture and its subsequent refinements and adaptations.  Himalayan Wildlife Foundation The Rohtas Fort Conservation Programme was conceived by the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation in 2000 to help protect the sixteenth century Rohtas Fort near Jhelum and develop it as a heritage site conforming to international standards of conservation and tourism. It is undertaking the following projects in conjunction with the Royal Norwegian Embassy. ",Pakistan

" Presidents of the Republic Of Pakistan In 1947 Pakistan became a dominion within the British Commonwealth with the British Monarch as head of state represented by the Governor General of Pakistan. In 1956 Pakistan established its first constitution and became a Republic and the positions of Queen and Governor General were replaced by the President. Pakistan s first president was Iskandar Mirza who was also the last Governor General. In 1958 he abrogated the constitution and declared martial law. A few weeks later he was overthrown in a bloodless coup d  tat by General Ayub Khan who had declared himself president. The constitution was revised and the president became the ruler of Pakistan. The constitution also stipulated that the president be elected by the people. Elections were held in 1963 and Khan defeated Fatima Jinnah sister of founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Ayub Khan continued as president until March 25 1969 when he passed the presidency to Yahya Khan. Yahya Khan stepped down after the Indo Pakistani War of 1971 and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto became the new president and presided over the formation of a new constitution. This constitution was completed in 1973 and reduced the presidency to a figurehead position giving power to the Prime Minister. Bhutto stepped down as President and became Prime Minister symbolizing the transition. The President was henceforth elected by legislative assembly members not by popular vote. Popular vote would be used to directly elect the members of the National Assembly including the Prime Minister. In 1978 Prime Minister Bhutto was toppled by General Muhammad Zia ul Haq who declared himself President. The presidency again became the premier position in the Pakistani government. Zia introduced the Eighth Amendment which gave reserve powers to the President s office. Zia died in 1988 and the Prime Minister s office regained leadership of the country. The Presidency retained its reserve powers until 1997 when the Thirteenth Amendment was passed. However the 1999 coup of General Pervez Musharraf brought executive powers back to the President s office. National and provincial elections were held in 2002. In December 2003 the Seventeenth Amendment partially restored the President s reserve powers but made the exercise of those powers subject to Supreme Court approval or veto within 30 days. In January 2004 the Electoral College gave Musharraf a vote of confidence as result of which he was  according to the Constitution  deemed to be elected. Musharraf s term of office as President is set to end in 2007. 01. Major General Iskander Mirza March 23 1956 October 27 1958 Republican Party 02.

" PUERTO RICO  Hurricane Maria the second major storm to hit the Caribbean this month crept toward the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday after it ripped through the small island nation of Dominica causing widespread devastation. Downgraded to a Category 4 early on Tuesday Maria remained an extremely dangerous hurricane as it churned about 235 miles  380 km  southeast of St. Croix the National Hurricane Center  NHC  said in an advisory. The storm plowed through Dominica an island nation of 72000 people in the eastern Caribbean late on Monday causing widespread devastation Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said in a Facebook post. Hurricane Maria grows on fearsome Irma s path I am honestly not preoccupied with physical damage at this time because it is devastating ... indeed mind boggling. My focus now is in rescuing the trapped and securing medical assistance for the injured he said. With maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour  250 km per hour  the storm slammed into the island as a Category 5 hurricane the NHC said. The winds have swept away the roofs of almost every person I have spoken to or otherwise made contact with Skerrit said. The roof to my own official residence was among the first to go and this apparently triggered an avalanche of torn away roofs in the city and the countryside. While the intensity of the hurricane may fluctuate over the next day or two Maria is expected to remain a category 4 or 5 storm on the Saffir Simpson scale the Miami based NHC said. The storm was on track to move over the northeastern Caribbean Sea and by Tuesday night or early on Wednesday approach the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico where millions are still reeling from Hurricane Irma earlier this month. If Maria retains its strength it would be the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in 85 years since a Category 4 storm swept the US island territory in 1932 Hurricane Center spokesperson Dennis Feltgen said. The last major hurricane to strike Puerto Rico directly was Georges which made landfall there as a Category 3 storm in 1998 he said. Hurricane Irma s deadly passage batters Caribbean at least 12 dead The governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossello urged island residents on Twitter to brace for the storm s arrival saying It is time to seek refuge with a family member friend or head to a state shelter. Puerto Rico narrowly avoided a direct hit two weeks ago from Hurricane Irma which reached a rare Category 5 status and ranked as the most powerful Atlantic storm on record before devastating several smaller islands including the US Virgin Islands of St. Thomas and St. John. Prayers and Mattresses US Virgin Islands Governor Kenneth Mapp said Maria was due to pass within 10 miles of the island of St. Croix which escaped the brunt of Irma s clout on September 6. The island is home to about 55000 year round residents roughly half of the entire territory s population. Mapp warned that hurricane force winds were expected to howl across St. Croix for eight hours accompanied by up to a foot and a half  46 cm  of rain that would be followed by nearly a week of additional showers. At an evening news conference he predicted most islanders would be without electricity for weeks and that some folks will not get power in months. A curfew will be imposed starting at 10 a.m. local time on Tuesday he said. Mapp asked the public for prayers and urged St. Croix residents take cover in one of three emergency shelters on the island. For those choosing to stay in their homes during the storm he said they might consider climbing into a second floor bathtub and pulling a mattress over them to stay safe in the event they lose their roofs. Forecasts predict Maria will be the worst storm to hit St. Croix since Hugo a Category 4 storm in 1989. The territory s two other main islands St. Thomas and St. John which lie to the north of St. Croix sustained widespread heavy damage from Irma which killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and the US mainland. Maria was expected to whip up storm surges   seawater driven ashore by wind   of up to 9 feet  2.7 m  above normal tide levels the NHC said. Parts of Puerto Rico could see up to 25 inches  64 cm  of rain it said. Puerto Rico an island of about 3.4 million inhabitants opened shelters and began to dismantle construction cranes that could be vulnerable to Maria s high winds as residents rushed to buy plywood water and other supplies. Maria marks the 13th named Atlantic storm of the year the seventh hurricane so far this season and the fourth major hurricane   defined as Category 3 or higher   following Harvey Irma and Jose the NHC said. Those numbers are all above average for a typical season which is only about half over for 2017. ",Pakistan

" Islamabad raises hands for DJ Diplo ",Pakistan
" Musical duo Database started off the rave with a high energy one hour set featuring popular mixes of tracks ",Pakistan
" ISLAMABAD  The open skies of Pakistan s capital resonated with sick beats of electronic dance music  EDM  Saturday night as local DJs set the stage for the Grammy winning American musician Thomas Wesley Pentz aka Diplo. Shah Rukh Khan and Diplo to work together  Security personnel surrounded The Rock Musicarium near Lake View Park as hordes of EDM enthusiasts gathered under the stars at the semi coliseum venue. Musical duo Database started off the rave with a high energy one hour set featuring popular mixes of tracks such as  Lean On   We re Beautiful  and  How Deep is Your Love . Diplo set to headline concert in Pakistan next month Diplo took the stage around midnight. The king of EDM has worked with the likes of Britney Spears Madonna Shakira Beyonc  Justin Bieber Usher Snoop Dogg Chris Brown and Bruno Mars among many other bigwigs of the global entertainment industry. He flew out of the country right after taking Islamabad by storm but took to Facebook to share his experience with a heart warming message. I spent 24 hours in Islamabad... Meeting young musicians new fans students embassy folks parents artists security guards cricket players   bootleggers... I drank a lot of tea ate some amazing food. A few hours later I played a concert in the city in a beautiful amphitheater in a park for so many awesome kids that knew all the music. I couldn t believe it ... At the end of the show everyone backstage gave me hugs and hi fives and told me it was a good time but it didn t feel normal. I almost felt like crying because here we all were at the end of the show with our peace signs in the air at the end of the concert doing something that might be arbitrary for us ... On any Saturday night.. We do it every weekend and we don t realize it s a privilege.. For these kids from Islamabad Lahore or Karachi or the countryside this is the first time they have ever done that and it might not happen again for a long time. But tonight everyone danced and sang together and wished for a better future and maybe it might make it easier for it to happen. Thanks so much for inviting me shared Diplo in his post. ",Pakistan

There are extra border checks for travelers who visit the countries that america terms as a hostile enemy. ",Pakistan

" News time Badenweiler In the peaceful and friendly Badenweiler German President Heuss spent a monthlong vacation. During an extended spring walk our cameraman with satisfaction noted that Professor Heuss feels so right. Yet at his vacation home again recovered President made the first official act. He received the new Japanese Ambassador Ryuji Takeuzhi. Eilat In the Middle East are emerging more crises. The State of Israel which wants to transform the port of Eilat at the vertex of the Gulf of Aqaba into a naval base is again facing a difficult problem provided. Saudi Arabia considered waters of the Gulf and wants to block the passage of Israeli ships at gunpoint. The Saudi Arab opposition was carried out a few days after the first American oil tanker for Israel had broken through the 7j hrige barrier. The old motive for war Israel would again conjured up a second blockade. Geneva the peaceful image of the week was the Assembly of the former war participants in Geneva. The Association which has more than 20 million members sent delegates from 35 countries. And so it happened that one side by side saw Israel and Egypt in an undisturbed neighborhood. Target the former Warrior is a worldwide movement of mutual social aid in the peace. East Berlin the ghostly theme of civil war was on the agenda of the Soviet zonal Betriebskampfgruppen in East Berlin practice area was the Alexanderplatz square and according to order of the SED the battle group had the task to destroy a minority of counterrevolutionary enemies. According to the maneuver report the action was successful. Mage of character PIN away from the great world theatre in Zwickledt No. 7 the home of Alfred Kubin. These days the magician of the sign monastery celebrated its 80. For the lonely artist birthday and a vivid Canary was the most beautiful holiday greeting. For half a century the demonic images of visionary art were born in this room. What lives in them is the terror and horror history who far rushed ahead our time to To find a terrible confirmation in the fact of the experienced present. In the black and white brilliant stroke of the pen Kubin has found the form and the formula of his art. Fascinated by the specter of his century he conjures up as man and as ban artists. Beauty is beauty is Trump recognized also the new Republicans from Ghana and sent their beauty queen on a friendship tour to London. The Englishman inherently know what deserves a Queen and so they sought warm heart to the blessings of civilization of the dark skinned beauty everywhere endeavours. How richly blessed is the tenth German Federal State with beauties which proved the excretion of the opal works for the election of Miss Saarbr cken in Saarbr cken Germany. The Saarland capital wanted to not bring discredit and sent a fine selection of avatar applicants in the fight to win the favor of the audience. The large sell off of beauty ended with the victory of a small vendor. It is called Helga Drosse and is for their 18 years in very good shape. Dazzling in form Germany s biceps matadors in the Mannheimer Muse Hall were Marathon of muscle. With a much younger team she participated to the international competition of muscles against France. The most impressive performance offered the lightweight Willi Kolb. With 115 kilograms he set a new German record in the two terms. But also the French did play their forces. The third Olympics Jean Debuf won in the Mittelschwergewicht. With a total of 24175 kilograms the French result by 30 kilograms was lighter than the weight the German team   brought to the high line. Thereby our muscle Prince celebrated a powerful success. A sensation on the trotting course weather enthusiastic Italians at the big lottery prize of Agnano experienced trotting sensation in Agnano. The French record holder Gelinotte is favored. Checco PRA and Assisi To give a brief Intermezzo as a front runner. But a horse from midfield dissolves after a few meters. Irresistible it passes on his rival. The followers of the Favorites are disappointed. It is namely not Gelinotte it is the 5 outsiders Tornese which the Sulky veteran Mario Santi imposes on a murderous trot. Yet is not all days evening. The experts talk about a waste of power. Until the final Sprint will prove it. And there s even Gelinotte. On the inside Lane she takes on the track. But her attack comes too late. Tornese WINS and once again ensures the good reputation of the unpopular outsider. Berlin football final country fighting mood of the 80000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium in the play off for the Berlin football championship between Hertha BSC  white shirts  and tennis Borussia. The game isn t even two minutes old when following a corner falls 1 0 to Hertha. A quarter of an hour later the Hertha storm is skillfully in the game brought. Powerful Faeder prevails against two defenders and completed a 2 0. After halftime the benefits clearly Hertha s page are. The Elf from the Gesundbrunnen dangerously harassed the sanctuary of the violet. A few counterattacks of the Borussia remain the fate of Borussias without resounding success the 50th minute sealed. Dove no. 8 takes a template to a 3 0 over the line. So Hertha BSC becomes 16. Male Berlin Championship and participates in the games for the German Championship. Fairy night along the Seine for a few hours sank the bitter reality of our days in a fairytale night along the Seine when Queen Elizabeth ascended to the ceremonial barge Borde Fretigny. France capital shone in the splendour of a thousand lights and on the banks of the Seine the most famous pictures from French history purchased on this magic nightabout 6 kilometres was the ride and over   a dream backdrop stretched 6 kilometers as it never was built. The largest fireworks show in the world should be the conclusion of luminous night driving and in the shine of a Royal visit managed to France for a brief historical moment escape in a modern fairy tale.

Klaus Roger Horst and Arno brought their village in the talk. They formed a pop band and called themselves the Petards   the firecrackers and succeeded in what remains the most provincial bands denied  she made a breakthrough into the national music scene. And what them almost as much was worth  she reconciled the conservative villagers with the new sound from her Bach of Schreck. The telephone  a news and communication device today for everyone. It began its triumphal March 100 years ago. Old phones from the beginning of the third bear witness in the museums of the Deutsche Bundespost. Whether electrical impulses are transported or letters and parcels  the technology is only a tool. Man plans and organises. Also in a State of the art operating like the Deutsche Bundespost. It is the largest service provider in Europe. Many letters and postcards are now automatically stamped and sorted. The daily deluge of 32 million items of correspondence forces to the use of machines. Electronics and automation can also help distribute packages. The post transported approximately 270 million units in the year. With nearly 500000 employees and a budget that is nearly a quarter of the federal budget the post is an important economic factor. This creates obligations. For example for the provision of training places. the Federal Post Office annually trains 10000 young people far more than she needs. Screen text and data transmission  the news technology of tomorrow has already begun. You increase the range of services. In spite of technological progress the post will carry always letters   to the remotest corners. This is possible only with human resources today   and tomorrow if the memory has faded of the beginnings of the communication. Ludwigsburg Palace a monument of the Baroque in the South of the Federal Republic and one of the largest castle in Germany. The Herzog von W rttemberg has let it build at the beginning of the 18th century. It reflects the personal representation joy of its inhabitants and the urge of the former royal houses to external power and magnificence. The huge garden is an architectural part of the palace complex. He is not preserved in its original state but was created 25 years ago in the baroque spirit after studying old templates  with Lakes fountains flowerbeds and avenues. The huge garden flourishing Baroque   with this promise attracts many thousands of visitors every summer. A complex system requiring constant and meticulous care to present themselves in that State which may have once been the purpose  as a shop window and mirror of an era in which a few powerful many subjects deems ruled. And like humans so they ordered also the nature. The Federal Republic of Germany otherwise a strike poor country experienced violent labor disputes in recent weeks. The reason  new technologies especially the electronics penetrate faster and faster in many sectors of the economy and change the quality of many jobs or make them superfluous. On the other hand modern technology is necessary to streamline so that competitiveness is not lost. You will create new jobs. There was the toughest labor dispute in the printing industry. Here the electronics threatened an entire profession  the typesetter. These skilled workers with strike fought for their jobs. Only emergency newspapers in Germany published for days on end. Lead fitters work according to tradition  produce the letters for the print templates in the machine or hand set. This technique remained unchanged since the invention of the printing press more than 500 years ago in principle. Now the lead of the electronics need to be different. Computer controlled text systems replace the ancient art of the typesetter. Before the screen sit the journalists themselves or only skilled typists and type the text into the computer. The results are final proofs from which the break editor composed the templates for the pages of the newspaper. The final artwork is then made in the light set procedure. The social consequences of this technology are now has been absorbed by a new collective agreement  on the display screen equipment typesetter are employed in the longer term primarily their previously obtained earnings is guaranteed them for their entire working life. And other professionals are trained to without any loss of income. Maximilian Horngacher the man who brings wood to the blades. Soloists and orchestral musicians from around the world call him the master of his Guild. In his small workshop in Munich he builds the harps that carry his name 14 16 year. With 5 employees he creates the 2400 items of a harp in hand work and then adds them together. Half a year passes by to cutting wood up to the voices of the finished instrument. The harp Maker uses 5 types of wood including maple mahogany and beech. The wood must be stored and dried be. Because the strings are later pull with a force of 2000 kg on the frame. The trains tongues pedals the entire mechanism together with the threads and screw is made in the workshop. Precision is everything for an instrument which must retain its sound quality in the tropics and in cold northern countries. When the harp body inlaid with gold leaf is decorated the strings are indented. The finished instrument is played by a professional harpist. Then comes this oldest stringed instrument in the world on the trip. Already a musician waiting in Rio Tokyo and San Francisco. No airport but a parking lot for the Science  the Deutsches Museum in Munich a unique repository for masterpieces of natural science and technology. 1.5 million visitors of which learn technology in a year a quarter from abroad be considered part of human cultural history. From Zeppelin to the satellite  chronological order makes visible development. On this working table of the German chemist Otto Hahn the atomic age began 40 years ago  Hahn discovered the uranium fission. Only the file boxes give information about all the wealth of the Museum  from rough mouth lack of money store 2 one third of the exhibits in underground depots.

As the playful Brazilians surprise with hardness and closed team game and take over as they are warm played soon the initiative. An accident return from Bonhof Ze Maria opened a scoring chance. On the other hand Bonhof trying his luck as a penalty kick specialist. Rarely attack the Germans on the wing. Their game is powerful and unimaginative. The Brazilians soon uncover the weaknesses of the world champion. You win the most battles disrupt the attacks of the Germans in the midfield and then quickly push forward. Bundestrainer good consults with his players at half time. But the recipe to interrupt the flow of the game the Brazilians does not take the German team. In the 76th minute s time  the Brazilian of Nunes scored the ball from goalkeeper Maier avoided untenable. A weak performance of the German national team and an impressive appearance of the Brazilian team that has solidified her favorite position in Argentina with their win against the world champions.

" A Guide to German Etiquette ",Thailand
" Nothing s as easy as sticking your foot in it when you re abroad. But don t worry. Here the do s and don ts. ",Thailand
" 09.02.2018 ",Thailand
" dpa ",Thailand
" Shaking hands ",Thailand
" Germans are great hand shakers and they like to do so both when arriving and when departing. It is common for a person who is joining a group to shake hands with every single individual. ",Thailand
" Drinking ",Thailand
" Beer and wine are part of a normal dinner and alcoholic drinks are usually offered to guests. Not drinking however is completely accepted. Do not insist on alcoholic drinks if a person has rejected your initial offer and don t order them for them. A German who rejects a drink is not just being shy or polite but does not want to drink. For some cultures it is uncommon to see teenagers order a beer at restaurants and pubs. Remember that the legal drinking age in Germany is 16 for beer and wine and 18 for spirits. ",Thailand
" Punctuality ",Thailand
" Don t turn up late for an appointment or when meeting people. Germans are extremely punctual and even a few minutes  delay can offend. Be five to 10 minutes early for important appointments and be sure to call the people you are meeting if you really cannot make it in time. ",Thailand
" Du and Sie ",Thailand
" In private the older person suggests using the informal du to the younger person. In the business world the higher ranking person regardless of age and sex would always be the one to suggest switching to du. A nice intermediate step is to address a person by their first name but then use the formal Sie. Always ask however before you decide to take this step. If you re not on a first name basis in German you can still switch when speaking English. But don t forget to switch back. ",Thailand
" Titles ",Thailand
" Titles of nobility belong to an individual s name such as F rstin von Metternich. When in doubt it is advisable to ask. Academic titles also belong to the name such as Herr Doktor M ller or Frau Professor Weise. ",Thailand
" Flowers ",Thailand
" Bring flowers if you re invited to a German home for some social occasion. If the flowers are wrapped in paper remember to take off the wrapping just before you enter the home. ",Thailand
" Garbage ",Thailand
" Germans are extremely environmentally conscious and separate their garbage to facilitate recycling. If your neighbors spot you throwing recyclable glass or paper into the regular garbage your relationship could be strained for good. ",Thailand
" Kissing ",Thailand
" When close friends greet each other it is common to kiss both the left and right cheeks. However this is considered inappropriate in a business setting. ",Thailand
" Silverware language ",Thailand
" Crossing the knife and fork on your plate is an indication that you are not yet finished with your meal. Placing knife and fork on the right side of the plate in parallel is a signal to the waiter that you have finished and that the plate can be cleared away. ",Thailand
" Knocking ",Thailand
" When entering an office it is common to knock first and then enter the room immediately. ",Thailand
" Names ",Thailand
" It is polite to address everyone by their family name and Sie. Do not leave off double barreled names such as Frau M ller Weber. Names are inserted into conversation after every few sentences. ",Thailand
" Birthdays ",Thailand
" You do not have to throw a party for yourself but if you do provide food and drinks for all your guests.  In return they ll give you presents.  It is also common to bring some cake for your colleagues on your birthday. ",Thailand
" Closed doors ",Thailand
" Germans enjoy quietness and privacy. They may thus often close their doors but will be happy to receive you if you knock on the door. A closed door doesn t necessarily mean that the person cannot be disturbed. Likewise a closed bathroom door in somebody s house does not mean the bathroom is occupied. ",Thailand
" Telephoning ",Thailand
" Don t call people at home after 10 p.m. unless you ve asked them first if it s all right. Don t expect to reach anyone in the office after 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and after 4 p.m. on Fridays. When answering the phone in Germany it is common to identify yourself with your last name. ",Thailand
" Fr ulein ",Thailand
" Forget this outdated form of addressing young women. These days rather than being seen as polite it can be offensive. Just use the normal Frau M ller. ",Thailand
" Nudity ",Thailand
" In Germany you might be confronted with a much more tolerant open attitude to public nudity than might be the case in your home country. Saunas a minority of swimming pools and even some public parks on sunny days are considered to be textile free at least at particular times. Getting together completely naked in a sauna however has no sexual dimension to it whatsoever. But if you feel you would be uncomfortable it may be a good idea to ask first before you join a trip to the pool. This attitude spills over to television where the programs and even the commercials can feature more nudity than is the case in most countries. ",Thailand
" Greetings ",Thailand
" When customers enter shops especially smaller outlets they greet everyone in the shop. The same is true of doctors  waiting rooms. So practice saying Guten Tag and Auf Wiedersehen. ",Thailand
" Seating in restaurants ",Thailand
" It is common to share tables with perfect strangers when restaurants are full and very busy. Before you do so however always point to the free seat and ask Ist dieser Platz noch frei   Is this seat free  . Also wish the other diners at the table Guten Appetit. But don t expect any further conversation at the table. It may be very welcome but you shouldn t force it. When you leave be sure to bid farewell to your table companions. ",Thailand
" Toasting ",Thailand
" It s common to clink glasses with a Prost  cheers  or Zum Wohl  good health  before drinking. At official dinners it is more common to lift the glass by the stem and nod meaningfully to the others. The host should lead the toast. At a dinner party or in a restaurant you should not start eating or drinking until everyone in the group has received their drink or their meal and then follow the lead of the host. ",Thailand
" Typically German  These nine things really don t go down very well in Germany. A tongue in cheek warning. ",Thailand

" Franconia  The Bavarian Tuscany ",Thailand
" Upper Franconia has the highest density of beer breweries in the world. For many people nothing beats visiting a Franconian beer garden sipping an ice cold beer underneath shady chestnut trees. If you want to cool off you can go to one of the most beautiful caverns in Bavaria or speed down the slopes on a toboggan. ",Thailand
" About the region ",Thailand
" Franconia is situated in the northern part of Bavaria but after you ve been there a while you ll discover that the region has distinct traditions and a proud history of its own. This is where you ll find Franconian Switzerland   a nature reserve with many castles and opportunities for recreation. The region is home to numerous medieval towns nestled in the idyllic landscape. Visitors can experience the cultural highlights of today and discover the traces of Franconia s historic past. ",Thailand
" Getting there ",Thailand
" Take the regional train from Nuremberg or Bayreuth to the small town of Neuhaus. Get on the bus 343 otherwise known as the Beer Lunch and Castle Express. At the weekends this bus will take you through the region and after about half an hour you ll reach the Teufelsh hle  Devil s Cave  the first stop on your tour through Franconian Switzerland. ",Thailand
" Going deep and rising high  Tour 1  ",Thailand
" The Teufelsh hle is a stalactite cavern and is icy cold   even in the summer  the temperature inside hovers around nine degrees Celsius all year round. In this subterranean world you ll discover the papal tiara an organ and an entire skeleton of a prehistoric cave bear. On a guided tour through the cavern you can learn interesting facts about how stalactites and stalagmites form. There is no need to sign up in advance for a tour  simply ask at the ticket counter when the next tour begins  tours in German admission price for students around four euros . ",Thailand
" From there you can continue on foot to the lake Sch ngrundsee. The question is   should you head toward the lake first or climb up the mountain  If you decide for the mountain then you ll have the chance to take the summer toboggan run to the right of the lake. On the Frankenrodel  summer only  and the Frankenbob slides you ll zoom down into the valley at breakneck speeds. The Frankenrodel is a 1160m long stainless steel slide with lots of curves and zigzags. But if you d rather plunge  instead of slide you can try out the bungee trampoline near the toboggan run. ",Thailand
" My opinion ",Thailand
" A friend of mine at university first told me about the breath taking landscape and things to do around Nuremberg. Although I come from Bavaria myself I wasn t familiar with the region of Franconia. In the meantime I ve become a real Franconia fan  ",Thailand
" Proceeding along the edge of the woods you continue on your way to Pottenstein. After these physical activities the restaurant Gasthaus Krone on the marketplace is a perfect spot to take a break. Here you can sit outside and enjoy the specialties of Franconia. An insider tip for sweet tooths   the Apfelk chle  apple tart  with vanilla ice cream. This classical Franconian dessert is usually served only in the evenings but when it comes to Apfelk chle the cake chef is always willing to make an exception. ",Thailand
" For the rest of the day it s back to the Middle Ages  On the other side of the marketplace there s a small street to the right that leads up a steep incline to Burg Pottenstein. It s the oldest castle in the region and the central landmark of the town. Once you ve reached the top you can visit various exhibitions inside the castle itself. ",Thailand
" At the Scharfrichtermuseum  Executioner s Museum  on the marketplace be prepared to witness the sinister and brutal deeds of the past  The museum presents one of the darkest chapters of medieval history rife with executions the undead and severed heads. Paying the four euro admission fee you ll encounter fascinating tales of torture and its instruments and the fates of former prisoners. ",Thailand
" On the next day you will take the Brewery Route. We recommend staying overnight at the youth hostel in Pottenstein but you could also take the Beer Lunch and Castle Express back to Neuhaus if you d like. The bus stop Pottenstein B470 is located in the centre of town. If you start from Neuhaus take the regional train in the direction of Nuremberg or Bayreuth. ",Thailand
" More Photos ",Thailand
" On the Brewery Route  Tour 2  ",Thailand
" On your second day in Franconia take the Beer Lunch and Castle Express again and disembark at the last stop Waischenfeld. Perched above this picturesque medieval town is Waischenfeld Castle which is also where the tour begins. In the tavern located in the castle courtyard you can try a Waischenfelder Burgbier  castle beer . Or simply enjoy the view of the city from the viewing platform. A large medieval market with vendors court jesters and knights takes place at the castle at the end of August. ",Thailand
" From here you take the same way back down over the river and left down Fischergasse which will lead you out of town. At the edge of town you ll spot the sign Brauereienweg   Brewery Route  with an arrow pointing you in the right direction. Keep your eye out for this sign for it shows you the way along the entire route. ",Thailand
" Passing through a natural tunnel of trees and shrubbery you ll soon find yourself in the village of Nankendorf. There s a brewery here too but there are more traditional ones coming up so just keep walking  In the beer garden at the Krug Br u restaurant in Breitenlesau you can experience one of the most traditional sides of Franconia. Here you ll find guests sitting under large chestnut trees drinking mugs of cold beer fresh from the tap   the Franconian way of life pure and simple  Native Franconians like to drink their beer with Scheuferla  crispy roasted shoulder of pork  with dumplings and a side dish   a culinary specialty of the region. ",Thailand
" After this extended break it s time to head back. Simply return the same way you came following the arrows pointing to Waischenfeld. A small path through the forest and other signs will lead you back to the centre of town. ",Thailand
" This is a perfect tour if you like being out in nature and don t mind walking long distances. Taking the breaks into account the tour takes about four and a half to five hours. Naturally you could also sit down on any of the benches along the way and eat your own packed lunch   but enjoying a cold beer under chestnut trees in a Franconian beer garden is an experience you shouldn t miss. Before starting your tour in Waischenfeld we recommend checking the bus timetables to find out when you have to catch the bus back. In this way you can plan your breaks better on your tour. ",Thailand
" Conclusion ",Thailand
" If you really want to experience what the region has to offer you should stay for an entire weekend. Then you can combine the two tours with an overnight stay. ",Thailand
" Important information ",Thailand
" The Beer Lunch and Castle Express  bus 343  only runs from May to November on Saturdays and Sundays. ",Thailand
" You can only take the tour along the Brewery Route  tour 2  at the weekends because it s not so easy to get to Waischenfeld with public transportation during the week. ",Thailand
" Burg Pottenstein is closed on Mondays. ",Thailand

" Abstract ",Thailand
" Throughout the history of religions their holy texts and norms have been sources of images of men in societies around the world and have presented forms of masculinity that have found expression in religious acts and rituals. This volume examines how this reciprocal influence has shifted over time by bringing together research on different religious traditions from noted experts in the field such as Bj rn Krondorfer Yvonne Maria Werner and John Powers. It analyses similarities and differences in the interwoven relationships between specific religions and between concepts and practices of masculinity in different societies and cultures such as Western forms of Christianity during the 19th and 20th centuries European Judaism and Arabic Islam during the Middle Ages and South Asian Buddhism and Hinduism. This book is the first to compare research on a variety of religions and forms of masculinity and thereby contributes to the steadily growing field of interdisciplinary research on  critical  men s studies in religion.

" From good plain fare to multiculti ",Thailand
" The capital of Lower Saxony is home to foods and flavours from all over the globe and offers a huge selection of specialities from the Mediterranean Asia and Latin America. Good plain German fare is served not only in many local pubs but also in top class restaurants. Foodies can look forward to creative crossover cuisine with highly imaginative culinary combinations. ",Thailand
" Nearly every district has its own Italian or Greek. Turkish cuisine is also a firm feature ranging from simple kebab shops to sophisticated eateries. The choice of Far Eastern venues covers everything from fast food to first class. The magazine Hannover geht aus   provides comprehensive information  in German  about the culinary scene in and around Hannover. ",Thailand
" Queen of the vegetables and high spirited dexterity ",Thailand
" The traditional regional cuisine tends to be solid and substantial   as you would expect of the locals who according to the regional anthem of Lower Saxony have their feet firmly on the ground and can weather any storm . Most dishes are typically served with potatoes sometimes in new fangled variations but first and foremost as good old boiled potatoes. In spring asparagus is very popular  this finest of all veg tastes equally good with melted butter or hollandaise sauce and is normally accompanied with cured ham a pork or veal escalope or salmon. When autumn comes around it is the start of the curly kale season which is traditionally enjoyed with a regional spicy sausage speciality. ",Thailand
" Regional delicacies also include a platter of cold cuts and wedding day soup  a popular starter which contains tiny meat dumplings and egg garnish. Yeast cake topped with butter and almonds is traditionally served with afternoon coffee while Welfenspeise  a typical local desert consisting of blancmange and zabaglione takes its royal name in reminiscence of Hannover s role as the capital of the Kingdom of Guelph in the 19th century. ",Thailand
" L ttje Lage  a drink that is exclusive to Hannover originates from the annual Marksmen s Fair. The ritual has a strong alcoholic focus and requires two special glasses  one filled with L ttje Lage beer the other with clear schnapps. The trick is to hold the beer glass between thumb and index finger of one hand and the schnapps glass between the middle and ring fingers of the same hand and then raise both glasses to your lips so that the schnapps and beer can be drunk in one go. The L ttje Lage tradition dates back to the days of beer brewer Cord Broyhan in the 16th century. The Broyhan Haus   where the brewery pioneer lived   is now a gastropub in the city s second oldest half timbered building. ",Thailand
" Visitors who are interested in the history and technical aspects of brewing are advised to book a tour of Herrenh user brewery. In addition to the major traditional breweries Gilde and Herrenh user Hannover also has a large number of microbreweries which serve their customers first class home brew such as Brauhaus Ernst August on the edge of the Old Town. ",Thailand
" Excellent and unexpected ",Thailand
" Hannover s only Michelin star restaurant is situated in the only street in the region which is under a preservation order  Ole Deele in Heinrich W hler Strasse in Grossburgwedel which has defended its star for four years. Other top class restaurants in and around Hannover which have earned a mention in the major restaurant guides include Titus Die Insel Le Monde and Tropeano Di Vino in Hannover Gasthaus Lege in Burgwedel Berggasthaus Niedersachsen in Gehrden and Gasthaus M ller in Barsinghausen. ",Thailand
" However discerning gourmets also appreciate creative culinary experiences outside the ranks of haute cuisine   especially when served in an original setting. For instance who would expect to find top of the range and outstandingly fresh cuisine at Theater am K chengarten  tak  which is actually a cult cabaret venue  Or that eat the world  offers culinary guided trips around the city  Hannover is also home to the World Of Kitchen  WOK  the only museum in Europe that is dedicated to this subject. Not to forget summer events such as Maschsee Lake Festival outdoor venues including a large number of beautiful beer gardens and rooftop terraces such as Sch ne Aussichten 360  Roof Garden or 6 Sinne Skybar Restaurant. Another tip for culinary aficionados is the solar powered catamaran which cruises back and forth on Maschsee Lake from April to November and serves a fantastic Sunday brunch. ",Thailand
" Souvenirs from the countryside ",Thailand
" A trip to Lake Steinhude need not end when you return home as there are all kinds of regional treats you can take back with you for example from the traditional eel smokeries. Some Steinhude smokehouses also offer guided tours   which are best accompanied by a drop of the hard stuff such as the clear schnapps distilled at Warnecke s in Bredenbeck am Deister. What s more a meal at one of the many countryside inns is the perfect way to relax after a hike on the tree clad slopes of the Deister Hills. Another recommended souvenir from the region comes from Dupr s   Co. in Neustadt am R benberge the only makers of sparkling wine in Lower Saxony. ",Thailand

" Neben den regul ren Neuver ffentlichungen gibt es alle Jahre wieder seit 2007 die Booster Serie die sich laut Tangerine Dreams Eastgate Musicshop zu  one of the best accepted CD releases out of our very extensive catalogue gemausert hat. Warum das so ist wei  ich nicht. Denn eigentlich bieten die Booster Alben die stets als Doppel CD und Download erscheinen meist wenig Neues. So auch im Falle der f nften Booster Ausgabe. Neben 14 unver nderten Songs aus Alben der Jahre 2010 und 2011  Zeitgeist The Endless Season The Island of the Fay The Angel of the West Window Finnegan s Wake und Mona da Vinci  gibt es zwei kurze Remixe  Calymba Caly und View from a distant Star . Mit Shining Ray Twilight Dance Sailing through the Night und Booster Battery liegen auch immerhin vier Neukompositionen aus der Feder von Edgar Froese bzw. Thomas Quaeschning vor. Im 4 seitigen informationsarmen Booklet ist Tangerine Dream in der sechsk pfigen Besetzung von The Island of the Fay abgebildet. Konkrete Angaben zu den jeweiligen St cken fehlen jedoch. Da w ren mehr Infos schon w nschenswert. ",Thailand
" In der Summe ergibt sich ein musikalisch vollkommen konsistentes Album das bei all seiner Vielfalt der vermittelten Stimmungen von einer eher ruhigen oftmals mystischen Atmosph re des sph rischen Flusses im modernen elektronischen rhythmischen Puls gepr gt ist. Wem ein beliebiges Tangerine Dream Album der letzten Jahre gefallen hat  Ausnahme  Under Cover  der wird auch an dieser geschmackvoll zusammen gestellten Kollektion Gefallen finden. Diesem Eindruck dienlich sein d rfte auch der  berschaubare Zeitraum der Auswahl. Es befinden sich zwar auch St cke dabei die in ihren Grundlagen auf Alben der 70er Jahre zur ckgehen  Rubycon 2010 Resurrection of the Spirit  die aber soundm  ig bereits auf den ausgew hlten Alben so zeitgem    berarbeitet worden sind dass sie vollst ndig in den aktuellen Soundkosmos von Tangerine Dream passen. Die wenigen St cke die extra f r diese Zusammenstellung eingespielt worden sind fallen nat rlich auch keineswegs aus dem Rahmen. ",Thailand
" Warum nun aber gerade die Booster Serie zu  one of the best accepted CD releases out of our very extensive catalogue geraten ist erschlie t sich mir ehrlich gesagt nicht. Vielleicht lieben es die Tangerine Dream H rer einfach ihnen bekannte Songs in neuer Reihenfolge zu h ren  Vielleicht wird auch bei der geradezu un berschaubaren Ver ffentlichungsflut die Booster Serie als eine Art Best of eines  berschaubaren Zeitraums wahrgenommen  Wer einen Eindruck des aktuellen Schaffens von Tangerine Dream gewinnen will ist daher mit einem Album der Booster Serie auch nicht schlecht bedient.

" Als ich mir den Plot der Geschichte die Starfighter Aff re mit dem seeligen Franz Joseph Strauss als damaligen deutschen Verteidigungsminister ansah dachte ich spontan das w re doch die ideale Geschichte f r Amon D  l II gewesen. Aber auch Calvert schafft es mit Unterst tzung seiner damaligen Bandkollegen und anderen eine recht am sante Aufnahme daraus zu machen. Kern der Aff re war ja dass Lockheed auf Wunsch der Deutschen das Flugzeug so modifizierte dass es des  fteren zum Absturz mit leider sehr vielen Toten kam. Auf der CD wird der Wunsch nach Modifikation in einem sehr sarkastischen Dialog zwischen Lockheedvertretern und F.J.S. dargestellt.  berhaupt sind des  fteren kurze Dialoge zwischen den Songs eingestreut die den Fortgang der Geschichte aufzeigen.

" Musikalisch gibt es soliden Hardrock mit Spacerockankl ngen. The Song Of The Gremlin erinnert nat rlich in der  berdrehtheit an Arthur Brown Sachen der hier die Leadstimme  bernimmt.

" Insgesamt finde ich die Scheibe recht am sant wenn man Spa  an grundsoliden Hardrockplatten mit Spacerockeinfl ssen hat und witzig umgesetzte Konzeptalben mag. Unter Proggesichtspunkten ist die CD aber eher vernachl ssigbar. ",Thailand

" Location of the castle ",Thailand
" The contours of the neo gothic building rise more than about 330 ft above the river Moselle on an outstanding hill. The silhouette of the towering hill seems to continue in the building which is topped by the slate roof of the massive keep. As for its structure Cochem Castle belongs to the category of castles protected by height that had to be protected all around. Romanesque fragments found in the well indicate a reinforcement of the castle around 1056. ",Thailand
" Around this time or a bit earlier the core of the Romanesque square keep  17ft by 17ft  was built its walls being up to 12ft thick. At the same time the keep was also made higher. In the first half of the 14th century archbishop Balduin of Trier connected the castle and the town by massive walls. Furthermore a chain was installed below the castle to form a removable toll barrier across the river. ",Thailand
" History of Cochem Castle ",Thailand
" It is generally assumed that Cochem Castle was built around the year 1000 by the palatinate count Ezzo son and successor to palatinate count Hermann Pusilius. The castle was first mentioned in a document in 1051 when Richeza Ezzo s oldest daughter and former Queen of Poland gave the castle to her nephew palatine count Henry I. Even when Ezzo s family ceased to be palatinate counts Cochem remained connected to the title of the palatinate counts. Years later in 1151 king Konrad III put an end to a dispute concerning the succession by occupying the castle with troupes. Like this he finally took control of the castle which became an imperial fiefdom. Thus Cochem became an imperial castle in the time when the Staufer dynasty reigned in Germany. From this time on imperial ministers   with the title of Lord of the castle    were installed to administer the castle and the surrounding properties. ",Thailand
" In 1294 king Adolf of Nassau pawned the castle and the city of Cochem as well as the surrounding imperial property of about 50 villages to Boemund I of Trier in order to pay for his coronation as German emperor. But neither Adolf nor his successor King Albrecht I of Austria could redeem the pledge. For this reason the archbishops of Trier kept Cochem as a hereditary fiefdom until 1794. Under the reign of Archbishop Balduin  1307 1354  the old castle was enlarged and fortified. From 1419 the Lords of the castle were replaced by local magistrates. ",Thailand
" When the troupes of King Louis XIV  called Sun King  invaded the Rhine and the Moselle area in the war of succession of the Palatinate Cochem castle too was occupied in 1688. After the town had been completely occupied by French troupes in March 1689 the castle was set on fire undermined and blown up on May 19th of 1689. ",Thailand
" The French Sun King s troops almost completely destroyed the town of Cochem. The castle remained in ruins until 1868 when a Berlin business  man Mr. Louis Raven  bought the castle grounds and the ruins. Shortly after his purchase he began to rebuild Cochem Castle incorporating the remains of the late Gothic buildings into the main castle structure. ",Thailand
" The entire structure was rebuilt in the then popular Neo Gothic architectural style. This style corresponded to the romantic ideals in vogue in Germany in the 19th century. The trend at the time throughout Germany was for nobility or other wealthy persons to purchase and refurbish castle ruins as family summer residences. The Raven  family followed this trend and used the castle as a family summer residence. ",Thailand
" Today the castle is still well equipped with Renaissance and Baroque furniture which was carefully collected by the Raven  family. Since 1978 the castle has been owned by the town of Cochem and is run by Reichsburg Cochem Ltd.  Cochem Castle situated on an outstanding hill more than 100 metres above the river Moselle is a popular tourist attraction. ",Thailand
" Louis Raven  ",Thailand
" The Huguenot family originally came from Metz and came to Berlin in 1685 as religious refugees. The family ran a brass and bell foundry. The Raven  Company had its origins in the iron trading company Samuel Gottlieb Butzer which was founded in 1722. Jakob R. married the daughter of the iron trader on 14.08.1775. After the death of his father in law in the same year he took over the business. ",Thailand
" In 1824 Jakob R. signed the business over to both his sons and his son in law. His son Pierre took on the running of the business on his own in 1833 and under his management the renowned business became a wholesale company. His son the erector of the castle Jacob Louis Fred ric R. had a large active share in the rise of the company under his father s management he then took over the control of the company and enlarged it. He married Therese Elisabeth Emelie von Kusserow in 1864 who bore him three children before falling in love with a house guest called Gustav Simon. ",Thailand
" She was separated from her husband in 1874. Although he wanted to save their marriage he did not succeed. He died in the Czech spa resort in 1879. ",Thailand
" Not so many years after Raven  s death Theodor Fontane read in the newspaper about the auction sale of Mr Raven  s plant collection and wrote a novel called L Adultera . He based the novel s character van der Straaten on Mr. Raven . In 1854 Raven  received the 4th class red eagle medal. The title of councillor of commerce was bestowed on him in 1862. He was an honorary citizen of the towns Ilmenau in Th ringen and Cochem. An imported palm from the Comoro Island Johanna was named after him in 1879 as palm Ravenea Hildebrandti. His son Dr. Louis Ferdinand Auguste Raven  was 12 years old when his father died. He took on the family business in 1887 and in 1888 he married Martha Helene Wilhelmine Ende in Berlin who was the daughter of the family architect Hermann Ende. After his wife died he got married for a second time to Elisabeth C cile von Alten. He died in 1944 in Potsdam. His grave is to be found alongside that of his first wife s in Marquardt a district of Potsdam. ",Thailand
" The reconstruction ",Thailand
" In the course of the planning the construction of a railway line between Koblenz and Metz along the Moselle our region attracted the interest of Raven  and he fell in love with the ruin of Cochem castle. ",Thailand
" Together with the government building officer Hermann Ende Raven  put in an application already at the beginning of 1867 to the Prussian area administration in order to buy the ruin and rebuild it. About one year later in 1868 the then Prussian King Wilhelm I authorized the sale on the following conditions  ",Thailand
" The preservation of the standing ruins and the reconstruction according to historic parameters  copperplate brown and Hogenberg  ",Thailand
" Authorization of the building plans by the Minister for science and culture ",Thailand
" Partial opening of the castle for the public ",Thailand
" Pre emption right of the state ",Thailand
" The sum of 300 Talers was a symbolic price they orientated themselves on a similar case   the sale of the ruin Hammerstein. ",Thailand
" In June 1868 under the direction of Professor and royal building officer Ende they started to clear away the huge piles of debris and uncovered and secured all the foundation walls and the foundations as well as cellars on the Moselle side of the castle and the castle well. The castle was rebuilt on top and the highest rooms were furnished for the constructor. ",Thailand
" As from 1871 the second part of the reconstruction was started under the direction of building officer Julius Carl Raschdorff. Building officer Raschdorff was known for renaissance buildings  the Wallraf Richartz museum in Cologne  he had previously been town master builder in Cologne and had already acquired an excellent reputation. ",Thailand
" The planning of the exterior was kept in accordance with the conditions of sale. The sketched plans from the architectural drawing book are still available today. The planning of the interior was also left to Raschdorff however these sketches were not passed on down to us today. The interior design was assigned to Prof. Ernst Ewald from Berlin. He designed the intricate painted decoration on the ceilings and the walls on the inside and the outside. The poker work he carried out either himself or had his employees G the and the painter M nster from Cologne do it for him. But local artists and craftsmen also played a part. The rooms are accordingly decorative and the furniture is appropriately comfortable. The old styles of building were taken into consideration which had been used in its one thousand year old history. ",Thailand
" SConsequently our guests today during the guided tour will come across amongst other things a dining room in Neo renaissance style a gothic and a Romanesque room. In 1877 the inauguration of the castle and the opening of the Emperor Wilhelm railway tunnel were celebrated with a banquet in the knight s hall in the castle. High ranking guests were present. The seat next to Mr Raven  however remained empty as his wife had left him. ",Thailand
" Legends around the castle ",Thailand
" The battle of the barrels ",Thailand
" We are in Cochem castle. The year of its construction dates back to 1000 AD. The castle was a medieval structure of defence like other knights  castles but maybe a little nobler as it housed the counts of the Palatinate along the Rhine who were related to the German Emperors at the time when they were all called Emperor Otto. The history of the castle ranked itself seamlessly in the social fabric of its time with its intrigues and battles of power. Favourable marriages increased the powers of the powerful. But also murder and manslaughter were common in order to assassinate disagreeable fellow men and rivals. And so it came to pass that in 1062 Countess Mathilde of the Palatinate had the death of her husband on her conscience or for instance Count Hermann of Salm and Luxembourg former German King accidentally stoned to death the vigilant damsel of the castle in 1086. The counts of the Rhineland Palatinate   their territories wedged between the archdioceses of Cologne Trier and Mainz   left the Moselle region and took up residence from then on in Heidelberg. The Prince of the Electorate and Archbishop of Trier used this opportunity to unite the Archdiocese Trier with Koblenz. Cochem Castle became an administration centre the Moselle region was on the whole spared of various wars and the people of the Moselle were fond of saying life is good under the rule of the hooked staff . It was however never entirely peaceful in the German states. The Knight Franz of Sickingen and his troupes drew in on Trier. The Prince of the Electorate called on the people of his electorate for help. From Cochem and Zell 386 armed men marched hurriedly to Trier. You have to credit them for their bravery because Knight Franz gave up the siege and withdrew. However his troupes enraged by the lost chance of a victory took out their anger on the Moselle villages. One of these mobs approached Cochem. When they saw the town s gates were barricaded they camped out on the meadow by the Endert stream and prepared themselves to storm the town. The councillors of Cochem who had to organise the defence of the town were in dire straits. Then one of them had an idea. They ordered everyone to roll the empty wine barrels up to the Endert town gateway and to pile them up high. As the ramshackle mob began to storm the town the next morning they pushed over the pyramid of barrels. The barrels rumbled and tumbled down the hill straight into the ranks of the attackers. They were oppressed and crushed and withdrew. They thought of course in a town with so many empty wine barrels there could hardly be any full wine barrels left to loot  The people of Cochem still tell the tale today over a round of drinks about their cunning ruse back then and the victory of the battle of the barrels  ",Thailand
" Knipp Monday ",Thailand
" There is supposed to have been more than 40.000 Knights  castles at one time in the German speaking part of Europe. They were the fortified bases of powerful people. They reported back on movements of troupes in their areas and were supposed to be able to fight small conflicts until the local lords summoned together enough troupes for a battle. Such a surprise attack on Cochem castle was uncovered by a castle servant who was riding along on high ground up in the village of Faid on white Sunday   the 1st Sunday after Easter  on his way to visiting his sweetheart. He encountered armed strangers and heard about their planned attack on Cochem castle. The servant galloped away immediately back to the castle and raised alarm. The men at the castle armed themselves ready for defence. The next morning when the mob attacked the castle they ended up beating a speedy retreat with bloody heads. The lord of the castle was very grateful to his men for their vigilance and bravery he gave them the day off work and declared the Monday after white Sunday to be a public holiday for the people of the castle and the town for evermore. Since then the people of Cochem make their way with baskets full of food and jugs full of wine to a meadow by the name of Knipp  just above the castle where the attackers had prepared their assault that time. They eat drink sing and make merry and the young people make up for what the servant and his sweetheart had to go without on that day back then  They celebrate every year since then Knipp Monday .

" Life in the country sounds romantic. We have this ideal image from children s books with a small house lots of animals green nature and tranquillity. But in reality many people move away from the countryside to the cities. Nature and tranquillity also mean that we have to accept a few kilometres  drive to the bank cinema or doctor. Like many rural regions in Germany the Altmark is struggling to attract young doctors and wants to make work more attractive for doctors and nurses. There are elderly people who need good medical care especially in the countryside. The expansion of broadband should also enable additional services such as remote diagnosis. ",Thailand
" The supply of fresh food is very good in the Altmark you will even find shopping facilities in small villages. Since many foods are grown and harvested locally farmers like to take advantage of the opportunity for personal direct marketing.

" Tiruva   malai T luk.  North western t luk of South Arcot District Madras lying between 11  58  and 12  35  N. and 78  38  and 79  17  E. In the west a spur of the Jav di Hills of North Arcot locally known as the Tenmalais   south hills   runs down into it   and in the south it includes the corner of the Kalr yan Hills round about Chekkadi which is sometimes called the Chekkadi hills. Both these ranges are malarious. They are inhabited by Malaiy lis a body of Tamils who at some remote period settled upon them and now differ considerably from their fellows in the plains in their ways and customs. On them are large blocks of  reserved  forest in which grow sandal wood teak and a few other timber trees forming the most important of the Reserves in the District. Tiruva   malai is  S. 401  the largest t luk in South Arcot its area being 1009 square miles and its population which numbered 244085 in 1901 compared with 205403 in 1891 increased during that decade by 18.8 per cent. showing a higher rate of growth than any other. It is still however the most sparsely peopled in the District the density being only 242 persons per square mile compared with the District average of 450. It contains 400 villages and one town the municipality of Tiruva   malai  population 17069  the head quarters. The rainfall is the lightest in South Arcot being 36 inches annually compared with the District average of 43 inches   and the t luk is more liable to scarcity than its neighbours. The demand for land revenue and cesses in 1903 4 amounted to Rs. 432000. ",Thailand
" Tiruva   malai Town. Head quarters of the t luk of the same name in South Arcot District Madras situated in 12  14  N. and 79  4  E. with a station on the Villupuram Dharmavaram branch of the South Indian Railway. The population in 1901 was 17069 of whom 14981 were Hindus 1932 Musalmans and the rest Christians. Roads diverge in four directions and it is an entrepot of trade between South Arcot and the country to the west. The name means  holy fire hill  and is derived from the isolated peak at the back of the town 2668 feet above the sea which is a conspicuous object for many miles around. The story runs that  iva and P rvat  his wife were walking one evening in the flower garden of Kail  a when P rvat  playfully put her hands over  iva s eyes. Instantly the whole world became darkened and the sun and moon ceased to give light   and though to  iva and his wife it seemed only a moment yet to the unfortunate dwellers in the world the period of darkness lasted for years. They petitioned  iva for relief and to punish P rvat  for her thoughtlessness he ordered her to do penance at various holy places. Tiruva   malai was one of these and when she had performed her penance here  iva appeared as a flame of fire at the top of the hill as a sign that she was forgiven. A large and beautifully sculptured temple stands at the foot of the hill and at a festival in the month of K rtigai  November December  the priests light a huge beacon at the top of the hill in memory of the story. This festival is one of the chief cattle fairs in the District. The hill and the temple commanding the Chengam pass into Salem played an important part in the Wars of the Carnatic. Between. 1753 and 1790 they were subject to repeated attacks and captures. From 1760 the place was a British post and Colonel Smith fell back upon it in 1767 as he retired through the Chengam pass before Haidar Al  and the Niz m. Here he held out till reinforced when he signally defeated the allies. In 1790 after being repulsed from Ty ga Durgam Tip  attacked the town and captured it. Tiruva   malai was constituted a municipality in 1896.  S. 402  The receipts and expenditure up to 1902 3 averaged Rs. 18800 and Rs. 18500 respectively. In 1903 4 the income most of which was derived from tolls and the house and land taxes was Rs. 20800   and the expenditure was Rs. 19100. The municipal area covers 11 square miles. One of the chief reasons for bringing it under sanitary control was that cholera used frequently to break out at the annual festival and be carried by the fleeing pilgrims far and wide through the District. The great want of the place is a proper water supply and experiments are in course of initiation. ",Thailand

" A  aiva sacred complex of South India ",Thailand
" This is a collective programme of the Ecole Fran aise d Extr me Orient  Pondicherry  in which have been involved an Indian epigraphist  French Institute of Pondicherry  three members of the E.F.E.O.  covering geography archaeology architecture iconography and related studies  an E.H.E.S.S. researcher  in ethnology  and a doctoral student in demography holding a scholarship for a period of study in India. In addition there was assistance from Indian associates  in Pondicherry  primarily in epigraphy  rubbings card indexing etc.  ",Thailand
" The project ",Thailand
" These studies of Tiruva   malai originated with an historical enquiry   the antiquity of this sacred complex is attested by an epigraphical corpus which showed itself to be more significant than previously supposed when the epigraphist found that only a part of the inscriptions on the temple walls were recorded by the Epigraphy Department. ",Thailand
" To undertake an overall survey of the temple and its surrounding area was the logical consequence of this first discovery. And since the object of this study was a sacred complex within a fully active town a temple that had been constantly renovated over several centuries it could not be limited to archaeology in the usual sense of the term. Other perspectives had to be considered which would take into account not only the past but also a more sociological dimension as well as modern developments. ",Thailand
" Field work ",Thailand
" The rubbings begun in 1980 but completed only in 1984 included rediscovered inscriptions from various places within the temple the town and the surrounding villages as well as several recently discovered copperplates. Archaeological and iconographical analyses and other investigations started gradually in 1981 and were carried out mainly between 1982 and 1984   several other complementary studies were undertaken in 1986. None of the participants were able to devote themselves to this research full time over an extended period. Furthermore the nature of certain of the studies  observation of festivals the search for and collection of documents and of information that was difficult to obtain  required that the research be extended over a longer period of time. Each participant although having his own field of research contributed assistance and information to the work of each of the others. ",Thailand

" The temple at the place which has been celebrated for its holiness through the centuries was patronised by the rulers of almost all the royal families of Tami n  u including the Hoysa as and the Vijayanagara kings. During their rule the kings themselves had made a variety of donations to the temple. Besides some private individuals too had contributed their mite for its upkeep and maintenance. Such transactions had invariably been put into writing and engraved on the various parts of the temple. In the course of the centuries the temple received additions alternations and modifications. During these times some inscribed slabs were broken of which some fragments were reused in the new constructions but some others were probably lost. Between A.D. 1806 and 18184 when Col. Colin Mackenzie was engaged in copying the inscriptions in the temples of the Madras Presidency he had arranged for copying the epigraphs in the temple in question. Curiously of about 500 items of epigraphs found here his assistants had copied only ten  South Indian Temple Ins. I Nos. 105 114 pp. 114 24 . Of these S.I.T.I. Nos. 105 107 109 110 111 have been subsequently copied and the rest are not traceable. Besides one line notices of nineteen items prepared by two assistants are also found in the Mackenzie Mss.  D. 2869 and 2760 of S.I.T.I. pp. 124 25 . The Office of the Government Epigraphist visited the place in 1902 and copied 106 epigraphs which were reported in that year s Annual Report as Nos. B 469 574. Subsequently their texts alone were published in South Indian Inscriptions Vol. VIII  Madras 1937  as Nos. 57 to 165 totalling to 109 because of the fact that A.R.E.  Annual Report on Epigraphy  Nos. 476 488 and 539 were each split into two. That office visited the place again 1928 29 and copied ten more inscriptions which are reported as A.R.E. 1928 29 Nos. B 419 28. In 1945 46 they visited the place once more and copied sixteen new inscriptions and reported them in the A.R.I.E.  Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy  1945 46 as Nos. B 66 81. Lastly they paid a visit to the place in 1952 53. In this trip they copied only two stone Inscriptions  A.R.I.E. Nos. B 212 13 of 1952 53  and four copper plate epigraphs  ibid. A 8 11  which were In the custody of the Executive Officer of the temple there. The epigraphy office had been able to bring 134 inscriptions and four copper plate records from 1902 to 1952 53 of this place to the notice of the scholars. In our comprehensive and sustained survey of the temple for inscriptions conducted intermittently from 1979 to 1984 we have been able to copy about 360 new inscriptions many of them in their full form containing important pieces of information and the rest fragmentary. Besides four new copper plate inscriptions have also been copied in this survey. A list of all the inscriptions arranged in a chronological order is appended at the end. They range in date from the last decade of the 9th century to about A.D. 1800. ",Thailand

" Chapter 1 ",Thailand
" Tiruva   malai in its regional context ",Thailand
" If we try to find out what fundamental urge might have made people settle at Tiruva   malai in large numbers we note that it was not the poor soils of the gneissic pediplain on which it is situated that have fostered the development of the town although through refashioning by the hand of man the water supply available has proved sufficient. ",Thailand
" The urban community seems to have grown around a spot where the divine presence was felt at some date unknown to us but probably much before it has been extolled by  ivaite saints in the 7th century of our era. The shrine dominated by the sacred mountain has thus generated the town and the landscape bears the marks of this specific factor. ",Thailand
" Yet if the settlement has not remained a uniquely religious one it is because locally it also occupies a position that is favourable to continuous urban development. Situated at the margin of hill and plain it is a contact town at the junction of two important arterial roads. Thus Tiruva   malai played a crucial role in military operations from at least the 15th century onwards up to the end of the Mysore wars. Under the pax britannica the town was to loose this strategic function and to confine itself to its religious role and its activities as a market centre. ",Thailand
" Chapter 2 ",Thailand
" The Mountain ",Thailand
" Fran oise L Hernault ",Thailand
" Tiruva   malai is above all its mountain which symbolises the pillar of fire from which  iva emerged. This myth has given rise to two iconographic representations. One of them is well known  the li godbhavam rti    iva appearing within the pillar of fire flanked by Brahm  and Vi  u in the attitude of worshippers. The other is a later development specific to Tiruva   malai where  iva and P rvat  are figured on a stele covered with semi circular incisions to represent the mountain  the rear face of this stele is a li ga which is visible from the rear niche of the sanctuary. This representation is known locally as a i mu i the high and the low. after the same words in poems by Sambandar and Sundarar. referring to the directions in which Brahm  and Vi  u sought the extremities of the pillar of fire. ",Thailand
" The mountain itself a cone standing alone in the midst of the plain appears on the boundary slabs of lands dedicated to the Deity of Tiruva   malai in the form of a triangle covered with semi circular incisions set either above the dynastic emblem of ga  abh ru  a the two headed bird or above the vase of plenty. ",Thailand
" The mountain symbolically defines different spaces. It is the wild uncultivated place  Tamil  k  u         as opposed to the cultivated area. This contrast is marked in the festival of Tiruv  al when  iva has his jewels stolen on the mountain in the West and finds them again in the East in landowners  villages on the edge of the town in the locality where according to legend the palace of King Ballala used to stand. ",Thailand
" At first the opposition between the top and the bottom of the mountain seems to be absent since there is not as at certain sites a temple at the bottom for the deity with his consort and a temple at the top for the deity in his yogic aspect. At Tiruva   malai the single temple  at the bottom  is identified with the mountain for which it is the substitute. The opposition is nevertheless marked four times a year by purification ceremonies  pr ya citta  for which the priests go up to the summit of the mountain. ",Thailand
" First at the time of the  ivar tri festival the appearance of the pillar of fire manifests the supremacy of  iva. A few months later comes the marriage ceremony the Union of  iva with the Goddess. A few months later again at the festival of K rttigai commemorating the appearance of the pillar of fire there is still union with the Goddess as is shown by the procession of the hermaphrodite  iva Ardhan r  vara. After K rttigai the fourth and last purification ceremony represents separation from the Goddess and the renewed manifestation of the supremacy of  iva the great Yogi. ",Thailand
" Finally as a symbol of the centre the mountain like all mystic centres emanates a space which is cardinalised in the same way as a ma  ala. The route of 14 kms around the mountain and centred on its vertical axis is oriented to the cardinal points by the distribution of shrines consecrated to the li gas of the directions. ",Thailand
" A few Pandya milestones which remain along the route inscribed with the division to which they belong have made it possible to reconstruct the division of this circuit into nine stages each corresponding to one unit of time distance the n  i  24 minutes  equivalent to 1.4 1.6 kilometres. Besides the shrines of the cardinal points the pilgrimage route is punctuated by small shrines founded by devoted individuals or groups hermitages about sixty sacred ponds wayside resting places for the deity during his two annual processions by Nandis and by footprints  p da  of  iva. ",Thailand
" Chapter 3 ",Thailand
" The Aru  cale vara Temple  description ",Thailand
" Fran oise L Hernault and Pierre Pichard ",Thailand
" After some ten centuries of construction and enlargement the temple today forms a large rectangle. 465 m long and 225 m wide. Its longitudinal axis deviates from the East West line by 13 degrees. If we assume that this deviation was intended to align with the rising sun on the day of its foundation this would have been on either the 16th of February or the 24th of October. ",Thailand
" As usual in this book the successive enclosure walls have been identified and numbered from centre to periphery. But according to local tradition  ",Thailand
" the present day  iva shrine marks the centre of a former courtyard covered at a later date and surrounded by an enclosure wall which would logically be the first one but which is known locally as the second. ",Thailand
" what the temple priests and officers today call the first pr k ra is the low platform of late construction around the central shrine. Properly speaking there is thus no first enclosure wall  but this numbering system may refer to a former first enclosure. It is also confirmed by a 13th century inscription which mentions a building in the third pr k ra   this inscription  214 230  is now located in the courtyard of the third enclosure. ",Thailand
" following this system the present outer enclosure wall is the fifth one which would tally with the tradition that there should be an uneven number of enclosures. Ideally this number should total seven which would be achieved by counting the rectangle of the car streets as the sixth and the pilgrimage circuit  around the hill  as the seventh. ",Thailand
" According to this system all the elements of the temple have been given a reference number which appears on plate 3. They are described in order first architecturally then iconographically. ",Thailand
" Chapter 4 ",Thailand
" The Aru  cale vara Temple  building chronology ",Thailand
" Fran oise L Hernault and Pierre Pichard ",Thailand
" The central shrine is obviously the most ancient part of the temple. This is confirmed by the inscriptions on and around its base which are the oldest in the temple  end of 9th and beginning of 10th centuries ad . These are however fragmentary ones some on the shrine itself some on the platform later built around it and some even placed upside down. This clearly shows that the shrine is of ancient foundation but has been completely reconstructed and altered  this is confirmed by the stylistic study of its architecture. The square hall adjacent to its eastern side can be dated to the 16th century and most probably the renovation of the shrine was carried out at the same period. The present second enclosure wall was built in two parts  the most ancient is the western portion where there are numerous inscriptions from 1030 1040 ad. This portion may represent three sides of a first enclosure  fig. 39  built soon after the completion of the central shrine. A second partial enclosure wall was then added on its eastern side  fig. 40  certainly before the end of the 12th century when the third enclosure was built. In its courtyard several structures were added during the 12th and 13th centuries  fig. 41  including a shrine for the goddess at the site of the present one which was first rebuilt during the 16th century and then again at the end of the 19th. With the fourth enclosure begins the plan with four gateways one on each side. The north and south ones however with their unusually small size and location on the eastern part of the walls  fig. 42  can only be explained by reference to the fifth enclosure which doubled the area of the temple at one stroke by a large eastward extension. These two enclosures must thus have been designed together as one project under the reign of Ballala III  1291 1342 AD  who attached his name to the eastern gateway of the fourth enclosure  but the fifth enclosure could not be completed before the 16th century. ",Thailand
" This was a very active period for the temple  fig. 43 . with this huge fifth enclosure and its great gateways being completed by 1570 and construction of the 1000 pillared hall and the pond in front of it as well as the complete transformation and reconstruction of the central shrine and first enclosure which was again to be greatly altered under the Nattukkottai Chettyars at the beginning of our century. ",Thailand
" This long history has brought about a drastic reversal in the image of the temple from a structure where the central shrine is the dominant element  cf. Tanjavur              towards a more complex design dominated by the gateways which are larger and higher as one progresses outwards. This reversal is not due to technical factors as to build a high tower above four gates involves more work than building a single one above the sanctum. ",Thailand
" The new model is more elaborate. From the temple as centre of the world the divine energy pervades the space around it in the four cardinal directions its growing intensity expressed by the systematically increasing height of each successive gateway   contrary to human perceptions and actions which decrease with distance  sight voice power. . . . ",Thailand
" Architecturally stressing the gateways instead of the sanctum implies that the approach may be more important than the arrival. It may be relevant to link this architectural reversal to the bhakti movement and its emphasis on personal devotion  the progress the approach to the god is then reflected in the entranceways to the temple by gates and doors which are progressively reduced until the dark central inner sanctum is attained.

" The town s archaeological remains ",Thailand

" The town which today with its 100000 inhabitants possesses about 150 temples had at the end of the 19th century only 10000 inhabitants and therefore proportionately far fewer religious buildings. These were essentially shrines consecrated to  iva for we know that the temples to Ga apati Subrahma ya and the Goddess are a recent phenomenon. ",Thailand
" Although there was a K l  protectress of the locality facing North it seems that a Durg  temple connected with a local myth was particularly developed and that its deity came to be considered the protectress of the town as is shown by the ceremonies at the start of the K rttigai festival.

" Because of the sacred baths which devotees came to take and the rituals accompanying them which involved large crowd movements the whole life of the area was intimately bound up with bodies of water  the Ayya ku am at the heart of the town and other tanks on its outskirts. ",Thailand

" The Sociological Pattern of the Temple ",Thailand
" The organization of one of the largest  iva temples is studied taking into account the temple epigraphy  Xth XVIth c.  and the changes brought about by British colonization and the modern legal system. The supposedly economic function of the temple as well as the concept of redistribution are reconsidered in the light of a study of the divinity s possessions and of the temple accounts in recent years. The investigation covers mostly the ritual services mainly priesthood temple management and patronage as well as the deity s status. At different levels the analysis tends to underline an ambiguity basically contradictory to the caste system hierarchy  whereas an asymmetrical relationship is ritually maintained between the priest and the sacrificer at the same time the possibility is affirmed for a Hindu of any caste to attain salvation in a direct relationship with the divinity. Through devotion and with a renouncer like self control man as an individual agent in the world is restored. From a sociological point of view this is having several implications  the priests are regarded as inferior to the non priestly Brahmins  power s image is relatively enhanced  sectarian movements have developed around spiritual masters. Moreover it turns out that Hinduism has contributed some of the basic elements towards the build up of democracy once the legal conditions for a modern State had been laid down. An introduction sets the temple under investigation within the variety of sacred places found at different levels of Hindu society. ",Thailand
" Compared with the other volumes of the collection which focus on Tiruva   malai as a sacred place the present one is the study of Tiruva   malai as an urban agglomeration. It is subdivided in two main parts together with a third shorter one which is not a conclusion but considers the question of defining what may be called a town in the Hindu past of South India. The first part of the volume written by C. Guilmoto a demographer concerns the modern city a t luk         t luk   headquarters of North Arcot District its recent development and its position within the urban network of Tamilnadu. Though Tiruva   malai remains a sacred place attracting thousands of Hindu pilgrims at the time of its K rttikai              festival this alone cannot account for the tremendous growth of the town since the end of the XIXth century. Today the structures and components of the city are fully connected with and dependent on the dynamics of urban growth that are at work all over Tamilnadu and India. ",Thailand
" C. Guilmoto s study is not a mere survey of a town. His broad aim is to understand the historical and geographical context behind the present development of Tiruva   malai. His contribution focuses on the characteristics of the town from various angles  regional geography demographic history urban social morphology and economic analysis. The convergence of these different but interrelated perspectives serves to develop a general framework in which it becomes possible to distinguish regional trends from Tiruvannamalai s idiosyncratic features. ",Thailand
" The first section is devoted to the description of Tiruvannamalai s regional setting in a semi dry area from the major irrigation zones. The regional agrarian structure with the transformations brought about by the introduction of groundnut as a new commercial crop had a direct impact on the prosperity of the town   an impact later enhanced by the development of well irrigation and rice cultivation. This study of the geographical and historical setting in itself explains how Tiruva   malai came to be described as an oasis in a urban desert. ",Thailand
" The main part of this section  I.A. 2  is however concerned with the detailed examination of the town s demographic evolution in relation to other historical changes affecting both Tiruva   malai and its sub region. Starting from the end of the XIXth century regular census data help us to delineate the main cycles of the town s demographic growth. In order to do that demographic statistics were analysed in a strict comparative way which allows to weigh carefully the respective importance of regional and urban factors  see Fig. 2 through 8 . During a first period  1881 1931  Tiruvannamalai s growth was rapid though erratic because of its vulnerability to the level of agricultural activities. In the 1960 s Tiruva   malai emerged from a long period of relative stagnation to become one of the State s most successful agricultural towns. Technological changes in its rural hinterland brought direct and indirect prosperity as well as large numbers of migrants to the city. ",Thailand
" The second section is a description of the town itself  first of its morphology  I.B  and secondly of its social areas  I.C . The town s structure derives firstly from the generic model of South Indian temple towns  a large central shrine with four converging streets and a perpendicular grid of streets around. The modern extension of the built up areas along the regional axes of circulation gives to the town a star shaped morphology a feature reinforced by peripheral industrial development. The link between residence and occupation remains to some extent related to caste membership. However important sociological and economic changes might have been since the beginning of the town s growth the temple and the old town s geometric structure still act as the guiding principle for the development of the urban space. This description of the urban morphology of Tiruva   malai is conforted by the point of view of an architect P. Pichard who analyses Tiruva   malai cadastral survey of 1927  I.B. 3  and also points out the centrality of the temple the density of the urban texture and the characteristics of built plots very long in proportion and further reduced by family partition typical of traditional settlements of people of good status in Tamilnadu. As to the previous periods the question remains open regarding the shifting and resettlement of the population surrounding the temple as the temple premises were considerably extended several times along the centuries. ",Thailand
" The morphological study is broadened by the analysis of the social composition of the town. It is worth recalling that the population of Tiruva   malai has increased tenfold within a hundred years which implies a considerable mingling of people in relation to the migratory flows. To supplement the general information provided by the census a rapid fieldwork inquiry was conducted at the street and house levels which made it possible to ascertain the approximative number of houses and households as well as other data pertaining to the main occupations social origins and to a limited extent only the regional origins of the population. Tiruvannamalai s present population is quite heterogenous and none of the largest j ti       c ti  or castes living in the surrounding region is numerically dominant  though inhabitants of agrarian origin constitute a majority they are further divided internally along social and regional as well as political and economic lines. Based on the memories of elderly informants and results of his own enquiries C. Guilmoto proposes two maps which can be compared to shed light on the development of social settlement in Tiruva   malai between circa 1910 and the 1980s. To a certain extent the social settlement remains segmented according to j ti and regional affiliations  particularly striking is the concentration of Muslims and that of Harijans who remain clustered in settlements  c ri        now called colonies  once at the limits of the town and now surrounded by newly built areas. However when the members of a j ti are scattered all over the municipal area socio economic factors tend to supersede the traditional settlement linked to caste identity. That also demonstrates the spatial articulation of social changes newly brought about by urban dynamics. ",Thailand
" The analysis of the economic activities of the town  I.D  presents the basic data for assessing the economic role of Tiruva   malai and its main actors. Whereas the industrial sector is limited to food processing  rice and oil mills  and to a few mechanical industries producing diesel and electrical pumps for agriculture the occupational structure shows clearly the importance of trade in the urban economy. The strength of the trading sector allows Tiruva   malai to play a crucial role in the economic relationships between the villages and within a large area of northern Tamilnadu especially because the town is a regional centre for the processing and distribution of agricultural produces. C. Guilmoto s analysis of the complementary functions of the wholesale market  mandi        ma  i   and the regulated market emphasizes the centrality of Tiruva   malai for a large area   a role which has limited the possible commercial development of the small surrounding towns. For Tiruva   malai is also the place where large part of the local merchants  customers is provided by what is called the floating population  the villagers of all the rural places round the city and the thousands of pilgrims thronging every year. With the help of its function as an interface between large rural areas and the urban economy Tiruva   malai has been able to benefit directly from the growing economic exchanges  traditional trading castes  mostly Hindu but with a significant Muslim component  and fractions of the better off local peasant castes were the first recipients of this prosperity. ",Thailand
" The last part of this chapter  I.E  aims at stressing the global spatial factor behind Tiruvannamalai s changing fortunes. For this purpose casting away the regional identity of the town would be misleading as its rural component has been part and parcel of its social and economic history. In the models based on the theory of central places towns are simply considered redistributive centers for their hinterlands and then ranked according to the number of their central functions. However this model is not very useful in the case of towns like Tiruva   malai whose growth is mainly the consequence of the transfer of agricultural surplus from the countryside to the town. The theoretical model presented here  based on gravity  aims at mapping various urban fields  Umlands  surrounding the main towns of northern Tamilnadu. It assumes that a town s attraction is a direct function of its demographic size. The map thus obtained  Fig. 26  attempts to sum up the various geographical settings of each urban umland. Differences are clearly related to the general economic orientation of the towns. With its very large umland  several t luks  Tiruva   malai as a classical type of agricultural market town stands apart from narrow urban regions relying on industrial activities. Its present upgrading to the level of a new district s headquarters is a testimony to its durable hegemony over large rural tracts of northern Tamilnadu. ",Thailand
" After this study of the town of Tiruva   malai as it has evolved since the late XIXth century involving many factors which have been analysed from different standpoints the second part of the book again focusses on Tiruva   malai as a sacred place but in this case the emphasis is on the geographical dimension of the sacred place through a study of the pilgrims. ",Thailand
" Based on a survey carried out by C. Guilmoto at the time of the festival of K rttikai in 1983 the first chapter  II. A C  attempts to estimate the importance of this festival by locking into the composition of pilgrims it attracts. Before analysing the results of this survey in a critical reading of the available literature C. Guilmoto gives an account of the main features and varieties of pilgrimages in India and in the Tamil tradition. There is no way to obtain a reliable estimate of the number of pilgrims attending religious festivals such as K rttikai in Tiruva   malai. The great majority of pilgrims come from the North and South Arcot districts and two thirds of them are villagers. Most of them belong to castes of peasant origins. Least numerous are pilgrims of Brahmin castes and Harijans. Regarding occupation 54  of the surveyed pilgrims belonged to the non agricultural sector and among them those who are engaged in trade or business are numerically important as already observed in other sacred places in India. If we take into account the high proportion of literate or well educated pilgrims it appears that those coming from wealthy peasant classes and from urban middle castes  excluding Brahmins  constitute a significant substratum of Tiruvannamalai s pilgrims. All these informations help to locate the site of Tiruva   malai in the hierarchy of South Indian sacred places. ",Thailand
" Another important feature of pilgrimage places are the pilgrims boarding houses choultries  cattiram             called madam       ma am   sanskrit  matha monastery  at Tiruva   malai  III. A D . 113 madam have been registered in the municipality out of which more than the three quarters are still functioning institutions. Also included in this census are monasteries with a spiritual leader hermitages  often founded around the tomb samadhi of a guru  and a few charitable institutions but 75  of the total are simple choultries each associated with a caste  Tabl. 25 . These madam are mostly located  Fig. 30  along the procession routes of the temple divinity. Many of them were founded or renovated at the end of the XIXth century as is the case of the wealthiest of them built by the Nattukkottai Cettiyar of Ramnad who at that time financed the renovation of the temple at Tiruva   malai   as they did in many other sacred places of Tamilnadu. Though the growth of the town has probably contributed to the increase in the number of madam this kind of institution is quite old and historically attested. The madam vary in size and type of building  some are simply an open space for resting many are houses of a usual type a few are well built with a sanctuary  III. A  Fig. 31 35 . A characteristic feature is the emphasis given to the dining area and therefore to the giving of food. The madam is in a way a festive space related to the ceremonies of the temple. ",Thailand
" As a boarding house every madam usually belongs to a group of people members of one caste and in most cases of one of its subdivisions who have inherited the right to occupy the madam as well as the duty to maintain it and to perform the religious charities  dharma  established by the founder. M.L. Reiniche s study analyses the diverse incomes of the madam  coming increasingly from various kinds of rents  and the religious purposes of the endowment  III. B   C . These issues raise several questions concerning the nature of such an institution whose material form is a building which cannot be sold and which consists of hereditary rights and duties as defined by the vow of the founder and supposed to be everlasting. There is also something of a paradox in the fact that in most cases the present right owners of a choultry constitute one segment of a caste although the madam was usually founded on an individual initiative. In the case of monasteries or hermitages there is always at the origin of the institution one individual who has renounced the world and become a spiritual head for a community of disciples  even in that case the present spiritual head may belong to a lineage of gurus  comparable to a descent line from father to son  while the disciples even if socially mixed keep some loose links through caste status and regional origin. The case of a choultry is comparable  at the origin there is an individual a devotee of the presiding deity of Tiruva   malai. who came from elsewhere and decided to found a choultry in order to have a place to stay near the sacred centre and to perpetuate his devotion through an endowment. It is then possible to follow in theory the evolutive pattern of a madam  the choultry with the duties attached to the endowment is inherited by the founder s sons or very close relatives  it may then remain the very private concern of the founder s descendants but it will more usually become the concern of the latter s locality group. Then through relations of kinship and alliance the rights and duties connected with the madam are extended to the caste segment. As a further development the madam may be taken under the control of the modern association of the caste  sa gha         ca kam   and then virtually every member of the caste has a right on the madam. In the latter case however the caste members living in Tiruva   malai have the direct control over the madam  whereas in all other cases the control remains in the hands of people living outside the sacred centre which they visit at the time of the festival when they stay at the madam. ",Thailand
" The last section  III. D  is the comparative analysis of the different types of choultries in relation to caste kinship and territorial settings of their members. On the basis of the information obtained from fieldwork maps have been drawn  Fig. 37 44  representing the territorial areas associated to the Tiruva   malai choultries according to castes or caste segments. From the global map  Fig. 44  it appears that the potential pilgrims having some rights on a madam located at Tiruva   malai originate from all over Tamilnadu  however the attraction of the sacred place is primarily important for the area and the t luks immediately surrounding Tiruva   malai and then for the North Arcot district. These results are compared with those from C. Guilmoto s survey  II. B C . Some other territorial distinctions are also pinpointed according to caste  castes of peasant origin versus traders  castes . It may be argued further that this analysis of choultries and the phenomenon of caste which presents itself in diverse modes makes evident that what is known as caste actually does not exist in itself  if not only as an abstract administrative category  but that it exists through the variable formations of small groupings. The geographical corollary is that each caste segment in its relation to the sacred place through a madam is located in a discontinuous area more or less delimited and shared by the territorial areas of other social groupings. The sum of these areas constitutes a potential network of relationships between Tiruva   malai place and an extended but discontinuous territory. ",Thailand
" The third part of the volume is an attempt to understand how and on what grounds a locality may be characterised as urban in a given socio historical context. Having analyzed the town of Tiruva   malai from various points of view and considered particularly its demographic and economic development is it at all justified to consider Tiruva   malai a town in the past that is before the British administration made it the headquarters of a t luk  More generally how could we define a precolonial town in South India  ",Thailand
" From the above analysis we may deduce that the urban status of Tiruva   malai is demonstrated by the geographical extent of its attraction from the demographical and economic point of view as well as from the socio religious one. Put it in another way the geographical extent of various networks of relationships centered on a locality confers on it an urban dimension. If we now consider the topographical information provided by the temple inscriptions of Tiruva   malai from the Xth to the XVIth c.  from which maps have been drawn  see Fig. 45 50  and the large geographical extent of Tiruva   malai relationships at various periods of time it seems logically possible to deduce that Tiruva   malai was already a town in the precolonial past. However the epigraphical information conveys only the point of view of the temple and almost nothing can be directly inferred about the urban nature of the human settlement around it. ",Thailand
" So in the next analysis are set forth first from a reading of the inscriptions some clues relevant to the subject  and secondly the potential role of a temple in conferring an urban dimension to its surroundings as seems to have been the case for Tiruva   malai  always admitting that a temple alone does not make a town if certain other conditions are not present . Finally a few hypotheses are stated in relation to the example of Tiruva   malai as one possible model of precolonial South Indian towns. ",Thailand

Head quarters of the t luk of the same name in South Arcot District Madras situated in 11  25  N. and 79  42  E. on the South Indian Railway. The population in 1901 was 19909 of whom 18627 were Hindus and 1.191 Musalm ns. A municipality was constituted  S. 219  in 1873. The receipts and expenditure during the ten years ending 1902 3 averaged Rs. 24800 and Rs. 25100 respectively. In 1903 4 they were Rs. 25800 and Rs. 27600 the former consisting chiefly of the proceeds of the taxes on houses and land. An estimate for a water supply amounting to Rs. 282000 is now under consideration. ",Thailand
" During the Carnatic Wars Chidambaram was a place of considerable strategic importance. In 1749 the ill fated expedition under Captain Cope against Devikottai halted here on its retreat to Fort St. David. In 1753 the French occupied it. In 1759 an attempt by the English failed but it capitulated to Major Monson in 1760. Later on Haidar Al  improved the defences and placed a garrison in the great temple. In 1781 Sir Eyre Coote attacked the temple but was driven off. ",Thailand
" Chidambaram is principally famous for its great  iva temple. This covers an area of 39 acres in the heart of the town and is surrounded on all four sides by streets about 60 feet wide. It contains one of the five great li gams namely the  air li gam  which is known also as the Chidambara Rahasyam or the   secret of Chidambaram.  No li gam actually exists   but a curtain is hung before a wall and when visitors enter the curtain is withdrawn and the wall exhibited the  li gam of air  being of course invisible. The temple is held in the highest reverence throughout Southern India and Ceylon and one of the annual festivals held in December and January is largely attended by pilgrims from all parts of India. As an architectural edifice it is a wonderful structure for it stands in the middle of an alluvial plain between two rivers where there is no building stone within 40 miles   and yet the outer walls are faced with dressed granite the whole of the great area enclosed by the inner walls is paved with stone the temple contains a hall which stands on more than 1000 monolithic pillars into the gateways are built blocks of stone 30 feet high and more than 3 feet square and the reservoir which is 150 feet long and 100 feet broad and very deep has long flights of stone steps leading down to the water on all four sides. The labour expended in bringing all this and other material 40 miles through a country without roads and across the Vell r river must have been enormous. ",Thailand
" The temple contains five Sabhas or halls besides shrines to Vish u and Ga e a. Its age and architecture are discussed at some length in Fergusson s History of Indian Architecture which also contains several woodcuts of different parts of it. The N ttukottai subdivision of the Chetti caste have recently been restoring the building at considerable cost. It possesses no landed endowments and is managed in a most unusual way by the members of a sect of Br hmans called D kshitars who are peculiar to Chidambaram and depend entirely upon public offerings for their own maintenance and for the upkeep of the temple. The management may be described as a domestic hierarchy each male  S. 220  married member of the sect possessing an equal share in its control. No accounts are kept. The D kshitars take it in turns to perform the daily worship. Except the temple the place contains little of interest. There is a resthouse built by a N ttukottai Chetti in which poor pilgrims are fed daily and many other resthouses provide accommodation for travellers. A high school in the town is managed by the trustees of the well known Pachayyappa charities. ",Thailand

" Inscriptions belonging to Kul ttu ka III s time are very numerous. This seems to get support from the fact that our collection of epigraphs from this single temple includes as many as forty nine items attributable to the period of reign of Kul ttu ka III the successor of R j dhir ja II. According to Prof. Sastri the former s relationship with the latter if any is not clear36. The same author in another context categorically states that it is quite impossible that Kul ttu ka III was one of the children of R jar ja said to have been one and two years old at the time of his death   for he came to the throne in A.D. 1178 within six years after R jar ja s death and took an active part in the war of P   yan Succession which had begun while R jar ja was still living. The evidence of Kul ttu ga  K vai and  a karac  a  ul  also points to the same conclusion37. But while examining the most important record from Pallavar ya  p   ai the A.R.E 1923 24 pp. 103 04 confidently says that the two children of 1 and 2 years of age were the children of R jar ja II and being an infant Kul ttu ka III the son of R jar ja II did not succeed his father immediately. This was accepted in 1957 itself by T.V. Sadasiva Pandarattar who has also categorically stated that Kul ttu ka III was the son of R jar ja II38. He has also accepted and stated that R j dhir ja II was the grandson of Vikrama c  a39. That the date of accession of R j dhir ja II may be A.D. 1166 has already been suggested as the probable one by Prof. Sastri40 although his ignoring of the other facts is difficult to understand. So the recent re study of the problem after an elaborate examination of the Pallavar ya  p   ai  S. 16  epigraph is good in so far as it goes to confirm the earlier views and for stating that R j dhir ja II was the son of R jar ja II s sister named Ne iyutaipperum 41.

Two inscriptions  132 133  engraved one on each wall of the Ki i g pura which are in Sanskrit and in the Grantha script of the 12th century find a place here in spite of the fact that they do not contain the name of the king or any other particulars relating to him on the assumption that Mantr  vara Bh skara who according to the epigraphs was responsible for the coming into existence of the g pura  g pur  daya kara am  and was an important Mantri of Kul ttu ka III. As shown below  see chapter on Buildings Works  the g pura along with the enclosure wall and other adjuncts associated with it might have come into existence by the 2nd year of the king s reign because of the existence on its wall of the 2nd year record  87  already referred to.

" The meykk rttis of the king are not seen in any of the inscriptions dealt with here. Neither do they contain descriptive titles mentioning about his campaigns and conquests of Karuv r and K  c puram or about his performing anointments  v ra  or vijay bhi  ka 45. However in five records three of the 27th year  114 115 118  one of the 28th year  120  and one in which the date is not preserved  129  the title Maturaiyum   amum P   iya  mu ittalaiyu  ko  aruliya occurs. This means who was pleased to take Maturai   am and the crowned head of the P   iya. The occurence of this single title amongst his 49 inscriptions dealt with here gives room to infer that the king valued the achievements mentioned here as important and characteristic of his regime while the other ones were of an ephemeral nature46.

" The villages of Sylt ",Thailand
" Twelve places each possessing a distinctive character. ",Thailand
" 25 miles of finest sandy beaches. Rough surf on the west coast the calm Wadden Sea with its tidal flats to the east. Unspoilt dunes and green dykes. Flowering heathlands and majestic cliffs. Daydreams and nightlife. Bustling activity and peaceful seclusion. Twelve places all of them different and each holding its own individual charm. ",Thailand
" The twelve villages of Sylt ",Thailand
" List on Sylt ",Thailand
" Blooming heathland frames white dunes and fishing cutters sway on the waves in the harbour. A walk around this headland is a sporting challenge in a stunningly beautiful landscape  List is in the truest sense the highpoint in the north. ",Thailand
" List s charming little harbour unites a vibrant atmosphere and maritime flair. The famous fish sandwich is still eaten on the go   but nowadays it s savoured against the backdrop of the newly designed harbour area with views across to Denmark. How fast do shifting sand dunes move  How do seabirds survive in a storm  Answers to these and many more questions can be found at the adjacent Erlebniszentrum Naturgewalten  Forces of Nature Exhibition . If after the buzz of the harbour you crave the tranquillity of deserted beaches all you have to do is follow the beacons of the two lighthouses which will guide you to the beach at the Lister Ellenbogen. ",Thailand
" List is not only the northernmost tip of the island. It is in fact the northernmost point of Germany itself. And that s not the only superlative offered by List. You ll find Germany s only shifting sand dune here and nowhere will you find fresher oysters  in Germany s only oyster farm between two and three million of these delicious molluscs are harvested every year. ",Thailand
" Kampen ",Thailand
" Art and culture nightlife and legends are united under thatched roofs. The lighthouse appears in a black   white robe and the Red Cliff shines in the evening sun  Kampen is Sylt s elegant address   and with good reason. ",Thailand
" Small but exquisite. Select yet open. Stylish yet charming. This is Kampen probably Germany s most famous village made popular over the past decades by its numerous well known visitors who come here for the unique natural scenery  fragrant heather and the tidal mudflats of the Wattenmeer to the east and the wild waves of the North Sea and fine sandy beaches to the west. Kampen gracefully combines tradition and the modern age. ",Thailand
" It is a place to explore music and literature and to be seduced by sublime nature  the incomparable golden glow of the Red Cliff at sunset. The legendary  Whisky Mile with its famous clubs is an eye catcher. Life moves to a unique rhythm here at any time of day or night whether it s for a romantic dinner or a party till sunrise. Germany s northernmost golf course is an unmissable treat  tee off within view of the Kampen lighthouse and the tidal mudflats. ",Thailand
" Wenningstedt Braderup ",Thailand
" Whether it s cruising through golden fields on a bicycle or galloping across green meadows on horseback. Whether it s leisure on the broad sandy beach or fierce competition on the mini golf course  this community is the island s family seaside resort. ",Thailand
" The twin community of Wenningstedt Braderup is especially popular with families. A wide range of fun activities including exploring the tidal mudflats of the Wattenmeer and a children s circus for aspiring acrobats are all aimed at the island s youngest visitors. Wenningstedt is built around the idyllic village pond and the Frisian chapel. It s delightfully pointless to argue which is more beautiful  the sunrise over the sprawling heathland and the golden fields of Braderup or the breathtaking spectacle of the setting sun at the western beach   why not take the time to enjoy both  ",Thailand
" Spend the day sunbathing on the white sandy beach of Wenningstedt and kick off the evening with a glass of red wine as you relax in your Strandkorb wicker beach chair or dine al fresco in one of the charming beach side bistros which serve fresh fish caught that very day. A visit to the Naturzentrum in Braderup will give you an impression of the vibrant life on both sides of the island  activities on offer include guided walks and cycle tours. The herb garden tours usually end in the midst of brightly coloured poppies and fragrant herbs with a cup of home made herbal tea. ",Thailand
" Munkmarsch ",Thailand
" At the small marina white masts rise into the sky the tides dictate the rhythm and a gentle breeze lightly whiffs over the mudflats  Munkmarsch is Sylt s maritime idyll. ",Thailand
" If you stroll along the mudflats today and enjoy the tranquility of Munkmarsch Bay it seems hardly conceivable that this cosy village was once the gateway to the island  until construction of the Hindenburgdamm in 1927 summer visitors could only reach Sylt by sea. Steamships from the mainland set course for the Munkmarsch harbour and from there people travelled further per island railway. As one can imagine proceedings during that time where rather exuberant whereas today you can leave your cares behind and savour the serenity of Munkmarsch   or the flavour of the many specialties in one of its gourmet restaurants. ",Thailand
" Now that the small private marina provides a landing stage for sailboats the bay has become an idyll which is also gladly utilised by surfers. If you want to give it a go and make your first windsurf attempts you ll find an ideal area here in the protected harbour. And from the water you also have the most fantastic view of the White Cliff that extends northwards along the mudflats. Be inspired by the maritime lightness and experience the most natural of all anti stress treatments. ",Thailand
" Westerland ",Thailand
" The island s heart beats right at its centre. With charm and laughter the island s capital unites urbane elegance with maritime buoyancy. Westerland is outright pure zest for life. ",Thailand
" Pamper your taste buds with culinary diversity  matjes herring oysters award winning cuisine and beach side bistros   there s something here for all tastes. Enjoy the thrilling spectacle of the Windsurfing World Cup take your team to victory at beach volleyball or enjoy exciting family adventures like beach expeditions pulling faces at the sharks from behind the safety of the aquarium glass or tossing yourself into the waves of the Sylter Welle indoor swimming pool with its spectacular views across the North Sea. ",Thailand
" Enjoy the same view as you are pampered with Ayurvedic oil massages or attend Qi Gong classes. A glass front turns the studio on the roof of the Syltness Center into a panorama lounge. The adjoining sauna complex set amid the dunes is too beautiful for only a brief visit. Once you ve recharged your batteries you can explore the island in all its diversity  whether by car or bus by bike or on foot with your  Nordic Walking sticks   Westerland s central location makes it the ideal starting point for excursions. Listen to concerts performed against the magnificent backdrop of the North Sea lose track of time while shopping conquer the surf on your surfboard and unwind in your Strandkorb  Westerland is the perfect place for all this and more. ",Thailand
" Tinnum ",Thailand
" Families particularly enjoy the island thanks to a wide range of activities for children. Centrally located in the middle of the island Sylt can be comfortably explored in all directions from here  Tinnum is the bridge between town and countryside. ",Thailand
" Tinnum actively combines the urbane and the rural. The well developed bike paths through the meadows offer wide views and the cycling friendly central location on the island brings all other Sylt villages closer. E bikes that provide built in tailwind are available for rent. And Tinnum also provides exciting tours for hikers and walkers. Tinnum Castle is a popular destination  the mighty circular rampart probably served as a cult site and later also provided a hiding place for buccaneers. You will find considerable freedom for individual arrangement of your holiday in a location   in the middle of the island   where town and countryside unite and horse drawn carriages roll through the green landscapes. And the sea is close in any direction  ",Thailand
" Keitum ",Thailand
" Frisian houses in the shade of old trees accommodate gastronomic and handcrafted treasures and the splendour of bygone times mixes with the colourful radiance of blooming gardens  Keitum is the Frisian jewel on the mudflats. ",Thailand
" While walking through winding paths and hidden trails you will be repeatedly fascinated by idyllic spots and stop in front of picturesque gardens. Former  captain s houses are strung together framed by traditional Frisian dry stone walls and chestnut beech and linden trees that are hundreds of years old. The shop windows under the thatched roofs of exclusive boutiques invite visitors to go for a stroll while cosy tearooms entice with home baked pastries and galleries exhibit works by insular and international artists. Outstanding chefs reinterpret Frisian dishes and creative artisans give traditional jewellery production a finishing touch here. ",Thailand
" If you are on the go in search of the chequered history of the village you will encounter Sylt s lifestyle culture of the 18th century in a very lively manner in the  Old Frisian House and discover many treasures in the local museum s extensive collection. Incidentally you can not only experience Saint Severinus Sylt s oldest church with your eyes  the organ concerts are staffed with top class international musicians who are known far beyond the island s borders. But despite all the variety you should always do one thing  walk along the mudflats   your mind will be beautifully clear. ",Thailand
" Archsum ",Thailand
" Lush green meadows stretch to the horizon and allow lots of room for the broad sky and crystal clear North Sea air. Nature predetermines the rhythm here  Archsum is the island s green haven of tranquility. ",Thailand
" In the smallest village on the island you will experience rural idyll and agricultural tradition  sheep graze on green meadows a small stream meanders through the countryside and yellow rapeseed fields glow in the spring sky. Old farmhouses sit enthroned on their dwelling mounds and thatched Frisian houses dominate the view. Here there is plenty of room for wide vistas and extensive bicycle tours through salt meadows and along dikes. ",Thailand
" Here you can discover the diversity of flora and fauna and very intensively experience the change of seasons   from sowing to harvest from the soft green spring awakening to snow covered glittering winter days. Between salt meadows and sea you will find tranquility and are nevertheless so close to the colourful island life. Enjoy this luxury of nature in deep breaths. ",Thailand
" Morsum ",Thailand
" The impressive Morsum Cliff with magnificent rock formations shines on the easternmost tip of the island and traditions of lively everyday life are set amidst blooming heathland and lush meadows  Morsum is the island s rural gem. ",Thailand
" If you ever want to walk through the geological history of the past 10 million years you should walk along Morsum Cliff. The over 20 metres high rock formation extends for 1800 metres. It is due to Ice Age displacements that the layers which rest in the darkness of the earth elsewhere shine in various colours in the rising sun  black mica clay red limonite sandstone and white kaolin sand. Fantastic views of the mudflats and the thatched Frisian houses of the cosy village are repeatedly opened up to you during hikes through the broad heathland. ",Thailand
" And if you do not know why  gallows are necessary on Sylt the natives of Morsum   who have fostered the tradition of  Ringreiten   Ring Riding  to this day   will gladly provide information whether it is while you enjoy a piece of homemade Frisian torte or during events in the  Muasem H s   Morsum House  the centre of the village. Set off in search of the roots of the island s history   living  sprouts  still grow here. ",Thailand
" Rantum ",Thailand
" Between the seas there is room for old sagas and young artists. Culture and nature are closely interwoven here. It s also just a short distance from the mudflats to the North Sea surf  Rantum is Sylt s narrow waist. ",Thailand
" This small Frisian village with its thatched cottages is surrounded by many legends. In the dunes of Rantum historical tales were born as were young gastronomic legends. The atmosphere is easygoing jeans and tweed meet trainers and high heels   everyone savours the treasures of excellent cuisine and wine cellars while enjoying the sea view. Wherever you decide to treat yourself in the evening don t miss a trip to the small marina and fish smokehouse. As well as offering smoked delicacies the marina is surrounded by nature and culture. ",Thailand
" You re never far from the beach in Rantum which lies at Sylt s narrowest point. Charming thatched cottages perch attractively on the dunes between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea with views across the waves andalways close to the heart of the island s magic. And the beach  It stretches for miles in the west and is only a few hundred metres away from the quiet mud flats in the east. You re never far from the beach in Rantum which lies at Sylt s narrowest point. Charming thatched cottages perch attractively on the dunes between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea with views across the waves and always close to the heart of the island s magic. ",Thailand
" H rnum ",Thailand
" Two seas lap around the broad sandy beach and collide on the southernmost tip of the island while the lighthouse guides walkers and excursion ships along the right paths  H rnum is Sylt s sunny south. ",Thailand
" Surrounded by gorgeous beaches and fragrant rose bushes. Watched over by the red and white lighthouse   which is worth climbing up to immerse yourself in Sylt s history or even tie the knot amongst a small circle of friends. Love with wonderful prospects including views across to the neighbouring islands the shimmering Wattenmeer the North Sea waves and the endless horizon. There are so many things to do here. ",Thailand
" Set off on a boat trip  excursion boats leave several times a day for the seal banks and neighbouring islands. If you want to control the rudder yourself head off to the Sylt Catamaran Club or the Sylt Yacht Club. The new golf course located at the foot of the dunes is perfect for practicing your stroke or simply enjoy a relaxing walk around the Odde. If you re travelling with children the wide eastern beach with its shallow shore is a true paradise. And if you want to know what exactly it is you have discovered in the sand or mud the mud flats preservation centre Schutzstation Wattenmeer will provide the answers. No matter which direction you ve come from the outlook in Sylt s south is always sunny. ",Thailand

" Abstract ",Thailand
" Dragons are portrayed in widely separated cultures as simultaneously male and female. While this trait may appear arbitrary its global distribution implies that it is motivated by observations available to all humans. Many seemingly arbitrary traits of dragons are shared by conceptions of the rainbow which is widely portrayed as having both male  primary  and female  secondary  arcs. This correlation of features in mythical and natural counterparts shows that the nineteenth century doctrine of naturalism which saw various elements of myth and folklore as reflecting features of the natural world was valid despite excesses that eventually caused its abandonment.

" Wilhelmsburg Ulm ",Thailand
" The  Wilhelmsburg  was built from 1842 to 1849 as the Citadel s reduit. The Citadel comprised work XII of the  Wilhelmsburg  and works XIII to XVIII of Fort Wilhelm and was the largest of the town wall fortifications. In contrast to all the other works  the  Wilhelmsburg  had no ramparts and consisted only of four re inforced bunkers in the three towers. Over the decades different regiments and units were stationed here. ",Thailand
" After the Second World War the  Wilhelmsburg  was officially used as a refugee camp although several citizens of Ulm whose homes had been bombed or requisitioned also took shelter here. At any one time a total of almost 3000 people lived in the  Wilhelmsburg  which had its own shop post office and school. ",Thailand
" In 1956 the newly formed German army moved in and up until 1970 soldiers were still stationed in the bunkers of the  Wilhelmsburg . ",Thailand
" Since then the more than 570 rooms have been empty apart from a few that have been rented out to companies. ",Thailand
